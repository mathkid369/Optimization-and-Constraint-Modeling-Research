# Optimization-and-Constraint-Modeling-Research
Most of the existing research in constraint model generation is focused on fine-tuning language models or using reasoning systems to promote structured reasoning. My project addresses this issue by taking existing constraint modeling and optimization datasets as a foundation and implementing RAG to strengthen the reasoning process of the model.
