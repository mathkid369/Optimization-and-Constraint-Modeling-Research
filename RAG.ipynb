      "Title: Robust single-source regional facility location with service, capital, and labor constraints for an omnichannel retail network\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: Given a set I of candidate regional fulfillment facilities and a set J of demand nodes (stores and delivery microhubs), design a single-source omnichannel network under a set S of seasonality and disruption scenarios with probabilities p_s. For each scenario s, demand at node j is d_j^s, travel time from facility i to node j is T_ij^s, per-unit transportation cost (net of headhaul/backhaul credits) is C_ij^s, lane tender acceptance rate is A_ij^s, the ramp-up availability factor at facility i is rho_i^s, and available outbound carrier capacity at facility i is CarCap_i^s. Each facility i has steady-state throughput capacity Cap_i, capital expenditure K_i, annual fixed operating cost O_i, and zoning feasibility Z_i; each demand node j has a service-level time target SLA_j and a minimum acceptable tender acceptance rate Θ_j; union jurisdiction feasibility for serving j from i is U_ij. The CFO imposes a total capital budget B and a permissible range [L_min, U_max] for the number of open facilities. Inventory pooling (safety stock) cost is approximated by a piecewise-linear function of the number of open facilities using breakpoints indexed by K, with grid values N_k and pooling function values SS_k scaled by H_base. The decision variables are: y_i  in  {0,1} indicating whether facility i is opened; x_ij  in  {0,1} indicating whether node j is assigned to facility i as its primary fulfillment point; n  in  Z_+ denoting the number of opened facilities;  lambda _k  >=  0 the convex combination weights used in the piecewise-linear approximation; and s_inv  >=  0 the annualized inventory pooling cost induced by the approximation. The objective is to minimize expected total annual cost equal to the capital expenditures of opened facilities plus fixed operating costs of opened facilities, plus expected scenario-weighted transportation cost, plus the inventory holding cost from pooling: minimize  sum _i K_i y_i +  sum _i O_i y_i +  sum _s p_s  sum _i  sum _j C_ij^s d_j^s x_ij + s_inv.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution must satisfy, for all j  in  J and i  in  I and s  in  S: single-source assignment, requiring each demand node to be assigned to exactly one primary facility ( sum _i x_ij = 1); activation linking, allowing assignments only to open facilities (x_ij  <=  y_i); throughput capacity with ramp-up, limiting total scenario demand assigned to each open facility by its ramp-up-adjusted capacity ( sum _j d_j^s x_ij  <=  rho_i^s  *  Cap_i  *  y_i); carrier line-haul capacity, limiting total scenario demand assigned to each open facility by available carrier capacity ( sum _j d_j^s x_ij  <=  CarCap_i^s  *  y_i); service-level compliance, requiring the travel time from the selected facility to each demand node to meet the node’s SLA in every scenario ( sum _i T_ij^s x_ij  <=  SLA_j); union boundary feasibility, permitting service only where union jurisdiction is compatible (x_ij  <=  U_ij); zoning feasibility, permitting openings only at sites that pass zoning/real-estate checks (y_i  <=  Z_i); capital budget, limiting total capital spent on openings ( sum _i K_i y_i  <=  B); facility count bounds, setting n =  sum _i y_i and enforcing L_min  <=  n  <=  U_max; tender acceptance reliability, requiring the chosen lane for each node to meet or exceed its minimum acceptance threshold in every scenario ( sum _i A_ij^s x_ij  >=  Θ_j). The piecewise-linear safety stock pooling approximation is enforced by convexity ( sum _k  lambda _k = 1 with  lambda _k  >=  0), by linking the number of facilities to the convex combination of breakpoints (n =  sum _k N_k  lambda _k), and by defining the resulting annual inventory pooling cost (s_inv = H_base  *   sum _k SS_k  lambda _k). All constraints must hold in every scenario, yielding a robust, feasible, and cost-minimizing network design.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize expected total annualized cost = CAPEX for opened facilities + fixed OPEX (including utilities) + expected transportation cost across scenarios (net of headhaul/backhaul credits) + inventory holding cost with pooling (via piecewise-linear safety stock function), subject to service-level, capacity, union, zoning, ramp-up, and capital constraints across all scenarios.\n",

The given data include, for each site–ring pair, a feasibility indicator A denoting whether the ring’s engineered path passes the site, ring size limits L and U specifying minimum and maximum allowable nodes per ring, a per‑site cap K on how many rings a site may join, a mandatory‑inclusion flag D indicating which sites must be placed on at least one ring, per‑site minimum memberships Lmin (e.g., higher for critical sites), an indicator E of existing ADM presence, the incumbent site–ring membership X0 used to measure migration changes, a maintenance‑window budget B for total membership changes, an optional cap M on the number of rings to activate, and positive weights alpha, beta, and gamma. The binary decision variables are: x[i,r], which is 1 if site i is assigned to ring r and 0 otherwise; z[r], which is 1 if ring r is activated and 0 otherwise; w[i,j,r], which is 1 if both sites i and j are assigned to ring r and 0 otherwise (enforcing pair coverage without multiplying decision variables); n[i,r], which is 1 if a new ADM is required at site i for ring r and 0 otherwise; and delta[i,r], which is 1 if site i’s membership on ring r differs from the incumbent assignment and 0 otherwise. The objective is to minimize a weighted sum of new ADM installations, ring activations, and membership changes, specifically alpha times the total number of new ADMs plus beta times the total number of activated rings plus gamma times the total number of membership changes.\n",

A site can be assigned to a ring only if that ring is activated: x[i,r] can be 1 only when z[r] is 1. For each ring, the total number of assigned sites must respect procurement‑driven bounds: if the ring is activated, its membership count must be at least L[r] and no greater than U[r]; if it is not activated, no site may be assigned to it. Each site may join at most K[i] rings. Each site flagged as mandatory must be placed on at least one ring (i.e., the total number of rings it joins is at least D[i]), and each critical site i in C must meet its redundancy requirement by joining at least Lmin[i] rings.

New ADM installations are linked to assignments and existing equipment: for each site–ring, n[i,r] must be at least the difference between the assignment indicator and the existing ADM indicator, so a new ADM is counted whenever a site is assigned to a ring without an existing ADM. Membership changes are tracked relative to the incumbent: for each site–ring, delta[i,r] must be at least both the positive and the negative difference between the new and incumbent membership indicators, making it 1 whenever the assignment changes and 0 otherwise; the total number of such changes across all sites and rings cannot exceed the maintenance budget B.

      "Formal Problem Statement: We seek to generate a themed set of K Battleship-style puzzles on N times N grids by choosing fleet placements and a minimal set of published clues so that each puzzle has a unique solution, obeys global no-touch rules, and matches prescribed row and column ship counts. For each puzzle p and cell (i, j), let x_{p,i,j} be a binary occupancy indicator (1 if a ship occupies the cell), and w_{p,i,j} be a binary water indicator with w_{p,i,j} = 1 − x_{p,i,j}. For each candidate ship placement S ≡ (t, r, c, o) defined by ship type t in T with length L_t, anchor (r, c), and orientation o in O, let s_{p,t,r,c,o} (also denoted s_{p,S}) be a binary activation variable (1 if that ship placement is chosen). For each orthogonal neighbor pair e = ((i, j), (i′, j′)), let e_{p,e} be a binary internal-adjacency indicator (1 only when the two cells are consecutive segments of the same ship). Published clues consist of binary hit and miss markers g^{hit}_{p,i,j} and g^{miss}_{p,i,j} at cells, and binary publication flags z^{row}_{p,i} and z^{col}_{p,j} indicating whether the given row total R_{p,i} or column total C_{p,j} is printed. Each puzzle p has an emulated human-solve trace: h_{p,u} is the nonnegative integer count of reasoning step type u observed in that trace, and d_p  >=  0 is the predicted difficulty score. Neighbor sets N_diag and N_orth specify all valid diagonal and orthogonal cell pairs, and adj(S) denotes the set of internal orthogonal edges for ship placement S.\n",

Board bounds: any s_{p,t,r,c,o} that would place a length-L_t ship outside the N times N board is fixed to zero. Non-overlap: at every cell (i, j), the sum of activations of ship placements covering that cell is at most one. Occupancy linking: x_{p,i,j} equals the sum of activations of ship placements covering (i, j). Row and column totals: the sum of x_{p,i,j} across each row i equals R_{p,i}, and across each column j equals C_{p,j}. No-touch diagonals: for every diagonal neighbor pair in N_diag, the sum of the two x variables is at most one, preventing ships from touching diagonally. No-touch orthogonals with internal-edge allowance: for every orthogonal neighbor pair e in N_orth, x_{p,i,j} + x_{p,i′,j′} − e_{p,e}  <=  1, permitting orthogonal adjacency only when the two cells are consecutive parts of the same ship. Internal-edge activation is restricted to contiguous ships: e_{p,e}  <=  ∑_{S : e  in  adj(S)} s_{p,S}.

Clue budget: the total number of printed cell clues plus printed row and column totals for puzzle p does not exceed G_max. Theme step distribution tolerance at the set level: for each step type u, the absolute deviation between ∑_{p=1}^K h_{p,u} and the target Θ_u^{set} is at most  tau _u.

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider the problem of sequencing multiple copies of semiconductor recipes on a single tool over a finite horizon [0, H]. Let R be the set of recipes and, for each r in R, let c_r be the number of required copies and D_r their common processing duration. Some recipes r in a subset E require exact inter-start spacing D_r + Δ_r, where Δ_r  >=  0 is recipe-specific. Cross‑recipe interference is modeled by guard times P_{r,s}: if a copy of r is immediately followed by a copy of s, at least P_{r,s} time units must elapse beyond the predecessor’s processing time before the successor starts. Each copy (r, i) may have a due date due_{r,i} with tardiness weight w_r. The decision variables are: integer start times S_{r,i}  >=  0 (bounded by H), completion times C_{r,i} = S_{r,i} + D_r (derived), a single-machine sequence π_k over positions k = 1, ... ,|J| where J = {(r, i) | r  in  R, i = 1, ... ,c_r} and π_k  in  J, nonnegative integer idle/guard times Idle_k between consecutive sequence positions, an immediate predecessor variable pred[a]  in  J  union  { empty_set } for each job a  in  J, binary precedence variables y_{a,b}  in  {0,1} indicating whether job a starts before job b, nonnegative integer tardiness variables Tard_{r,i}, and the makespan C_max  >=  0 (bounded by H).\n",

Repeat-with-gap (same-recipe cooling): for each recipe r and for i = 1, ... ,c_r − 1, the next copy of r must start at least G_r after the previous copy completes, i.e., S_{r,i+1} − (S_{r,i} + D_r)  >=  G_r.

Each file i requires r_i redundant copies on distinct disks overall and per-shift coverage q_{i,s} on each shift s.

For each eligible store–depot pair (i, j) in the eligibility set A, there is a set of carrier bids B_{i,j}; choosing bid b  in  B_{i,j} yields a per‑unit transport cost c_{i,j,b} and a lane‑specific capacity cap LCAP_{i,j,b}.

Let C be the set of customers with demands and time windows [a_i, b_i], D the set of depots with limited chargers, and K the set of vehicles, each starting and ending at its assigned origin depot origin(k). Travel times and distances are known between all nodes (depots, customers, charging locations). Each vehicle k has payload capacity capacity_k and battery parameters (Emax_k, initial energy Einit_k, and per-distance consumption rate), and each depot d has charge_rate_d and a maximum number of simultaneous chargers chargers_d. Drivers have shift limits shift_limit_k and minimum total break time requirements. Decision variables are: x_{k,i,j}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether vehicle k travels directly from node i to j; y_{k,i}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether vehicle k serves customer i; t_i  >=  0, the service start time at node i; L_{k,i}  >=  0, the load on vehicle k upon arrival at node i; E_{k,i}  >=  0, the battery energy of vehicle k upon arrival at node i; c_{k,d, tau }  in  {0,1}, indicating whether vehicle k occupies a charger at depot d during time slot  tau  of the horizon; br_{k, tau }  in  {0,1}, indicating whether driver k is on break at time slot  tau ; start_k, end_k  >=  0, the driver’s shift start and end times; z_{k,d}  in  {0,1}, assigning vehicle k to exactly one home depot; u_{k,i}  >=  0, sequencing helpers to eliminate subtours in an arc-based MILP; and lateness_i  >=  0, auxiliary tardiness variables. The aim is to minimize total operational cost: the sum of travel distance cost over used arcs, lateness penalties over customers, energy costs for scheduled charging at depots (proportional to charged energy/time via c_{k,d, tau }), and overtime penalties for any shift duration exceeding shift limits.\n",

      "The plan must satisfy: (1) Customer assignment: each customer is served exactly once, i.e., for every i  in  C,  sum _k y_{k,i} = 1. (2) Route consistency and depot departure/return: for each vehicle k, exactly one departure from and one return to its origin depot,  sum _j x_{k,origin(k),j} = 1 and  sum _j x_{k,j,origin(k)} = 1; and flow conservation at customers enforces that, for each customer i and vehicle k, the number of incoming arcs equals y_{k,i} and the number of outgoing arcs equals y_{k,i}. (3) Vehicle capacity: along any traveled arc (i,j) of vehicle k, the load propagates as L_{k,j}  >=  L_{k,i} + demand_j x_{k,i,j} − M(1 − x_{k,i,j}), with 0  <=  L_{k,j}  <=  capacity_k for all visited nodes, and L_{k,origin(k)} = 0. (4) Time windows and sequencing: if vehicle k traverses (i,j), then service start times satisfy t_j  >=  t_i + service_i + travel_time(i,j) − M(1 − x_{k,i,j}); each customer j must be served within its window, a_j  <=  t_j  <=  b_j. (5) Battery energy dynamics: along any traveled arc (i,j) of vehicle k, E_{k,j}  <=  E_{k,i} − consumption_rate_k * distance(i,j) + charge_gain at j, with 0  <=  E_{k,i}  <=  Emax_k and E_{k,origin(k)} = Einit_k; charge gains at nodes reflect scheduled charging, increasing energy in proportion to charge_rate_d and the duration of occupied charging slots. (6) Charging resource capacity: for every depot d and time slot  tau , the number of vehicles charging is limited by  sum _k c_{k,d, tau }  <=  chargers_d; energy accrual from charging equals charge_rate_d times the total duration of occupied slots for that vehicle and depot. (7) Driver shift and breaks: each driver’s shift satisfies end_k − start_k  <=  shift_limit_k; break scheduling ensures  sum _ tau  br_{k, tau }  >=  min_breaks_k and prohibits service during break slots. (8) Pickup-before-delivery precedence (reverse logistics): for every pickup–delivery pair (p,d), service at the delivery must start only after completing the pickup and travel, t_d  >=  t_p + service_p + travel_time(p,d), and the load trajectory reflects that the picked item remains on board until delivered. (9) Subtour elimination (for arc-based MILP formulations): for all distinct customers i  !=  j and any vehicle k, u_{k,i} − u_{k,j} + N x_{k,i,j}  <=  N − 1 to prevent subtours. (10) Depot assignment coherence: each vehicle is assigned to exactly one home depot,  sum _d z_{k,d} = 1, and its origin equals the assigned depot. (11) On-time service penalty linkage: lateness variables satisfy lateness_i  >=  t_i − b_i and lateness_i  >=  0, tying tardiness to the objective.

Skill-mix coverage (base): for every day, shift, unit, and skill, the number of assigned qualified nurses meets or exceeds the skill requirement. Single-shift-per-day (base): each nurse is assigned to at most one shift across all units per day. Rest policy (base, night-to-morning): no nurse may be assigned to a night shift on a day and then to a morning shift on the next day, regardless of unit. Maximum consecutive nights (base): over any sliding window of length equal to a nurse’s limit plus one, that nurse works no more night shifts than the specified maximum. Day-off indicator linking (base): for each nurse and day, off is at least one minus the total base assignments that day and is bounded above by one. Weekend-off aggregation: each nurse’s weekend-off count equals the sum of off over all weekend days. Fairness gap: for any pair of nurses, the difference in their weekend-off counts does not exceed the allowed gap in either direction. Fairness deviation to target: each nurse’s deviation variable is at least the absolute difference between their weekend-off count and the target. Weekly hours accumulation (base): each nurse’s weekly hours equal the sum of assigned shift hours over the days in that calendar week. Overtime definition: weekly overtime is at least the excess of weekly hours above the contracted hours and is nonnegative. Pair co-assignment linking (base): the pairwise indicator for two nurses on the same day, shift, and unit is one if and only if both are assigned there; this is enforced by standard linear upper and lower bounds. Pair-overlap cap (base): for each nurse pair, the total number of co-assignments across all days, shifts, and units does not exceed the specified cap. Maintenance closures (base): on closed unit–day–shift combinations, no nurse assignments and no agency usage are allowed. Preference penalty linking (base): the preference penalty contribution equals the dislike indicator times the corresponding assignment, thereby charging a penalty only when a disliked assignment is made. Scenario absence feasibility: in each scenario, a nurse cannot be assigned on a day they are absent in that scenario. Recourse change measurement: for every nurse, day, shift, unit, and scenario, the change variable is at least the positive difference and at least the negative difference between scenario and base assignment, ensuring it equals the absolute change.

      "Formal Problem Statement: Tank Transfer Scheduling with Sanitation and Valve Actuation Minimization: Given a set of tanks I with capacities Cap_i, directed valved connections E  subset of  I times I, products P, and discrete time periods T with initial period t0 and initial inventories s_{i,p,t0}, plan discrete fluid transfers to balance inventories, respect sanitation and purity, and meet external demand or target inventories. Transfers along edge (i,j) have a maximum per-period rate R_{i,j} and are quantized in units of a pour quantum q. Each tank i requires L_i consecutive cleaning periods before switching its assigned product. Optional external demand D_{p,t} can be satisfied via designated output flows in specified periods; target inventories S*_{i,p,t} are given. The decision variables are: s_{i,p,t}  >=  0, the end-of-period inventory of product p in tank i; f_{i,j,p,t}  >=  0, the volume of product p transferred from i to j in period t; n_{i,j,p,t}  in  Z_+, the integer number of pour quanta on (i,j) for product p in period t; b_{i,j,p,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether a transfer of product p on (i,j) is active in period t; start_{i,j,p,t}, stop_{i,j,p,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating, respectively, a start and a stop actuation of the valve on (i,j) for product p in period t; y_{i,p,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether tank i is assigned to product p in period t; c_{i,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether tank i is under cleaning in period t; and u_{p,t}  >=  0, the unmet demand for product p in period t (if demand is modeled).

The total number of links is L = ∑_{i<j} x_ij, and L is simultaneously a multiple of 3 and a multiple of W. Maintenance-aware external connectivity is guaranteed: for each rack i, the number of neighbors assigned to a different maintenance window than m_i is at least  beta . The graph is 3-edge-connected: for every nonempty proper subset S of racks, at least three selected links cross the cut (S, V\\S). Forbidden 4-node patterns are excluded for every distinct quartet {a,b,c,d}: no induced 4-cycle (it is prohibited to have links a–b, b–c, c–d, and d–a present while a–c and b–d are absent), and no 4-clique (the six links among {a,b,c,d} cannot all be present).

      "Formal Problem Statement: Given a set of scenes S, each scene s with a fixed duration dur_s (in discrete time slots), a required set of actors, and an assigned location loc(s) in a set of locations L; an ordered set of shoot days D, each with a set of permissible start slots T_d, a total productive capacity L_d (in the same time units as dur_s), and a fixed daily setup requirement setup_d; a set of actors A, each actor a with availability windows W_a  subset of  D  times  T_d, a call‑day cost c_call_a, an idle‑time cost rate c_idle_a, an overtime/meal‑penalty cost rate c_ot_a, a straight‑time allowance H_a, and a minimum turnaround requirement T_a between consecutive days; and a set of precedence arcs P over scenes expressing director/continuity ordering, together with absolute day offsets offset_d and a sufficiently large constant M, determine a cost‑minimizing shooting plan. The decision variables are: x_{s,d,t}  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if scene s starts on day d at slot t; y_{a,d}  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if actor a is called to work on day d; u_{l,d}  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if location l is used on day d; Start_s  >=  0, the absolute start time of scene s; r_{a,d,s}  in  {0,1} and q_{a,d,s}  in  {0,1}, which indicate respectively the first and last scene of actor a on day d (when called); S_{a,d}  >=  0 and E_{a,d}  >=  0, actor a’s call and wrap times on day d; W_{a,d}  >=  0, actor a’s non‑working idle time on day d between call and wrap; and o_{a,d}  >=  0, an overtime/meal‑penalty proxy for actor a on day d. The objective is to minimize total production cost: the sum over actors and days of call‑day cost plus idle‑time cost plus overtime/meal‑penalty proxy, plus the sum over locations and days of daily rental cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following. Each scene is scheduled exactly once: each s is assigned to exactly one day and start slot (the sum of x_{s,d,t} over all d and t equals 1). Daily time capacity is respected: for each day d, the total scheduled scene time that day plus setup_d does not exceed L_d. At each location and on each day, there is no overlap in time: for every time slot within a day, at most one scene that uses the same location may be active at that slot. Actor availability is enforced: a scene that requires actor a may only be scheduled at (d,t) pairs within a’s availability window W_a (x_{s,d,t} is zero outside W_a). Actor call linkage holds: if any scene requiring a is scheduled on day d at any slot t, then y_{a,d}=1 (equivalently, y_{a,d}  >=  x_{s,d,t} for all such scenes and slots). Turnaround between consecutive days is enforced: for each actor a and consecutive days d and d+1, it is forbidden to schedule a scene s1 on day d at t1 and a scene s2 on day d+1 at t2 if t2 starts less than T_a after the end of s1; such pairs are cut off by x_{s1,d,t1} + x_{s2,d+1,t2}  <=  1 whenever t2 − (t1 + dur_{s1}) < T_a. Absolute scene start times are defined by the assignment: Start_s equals the sum over all (d,t) of (offset_d + t) times x_{s,d,t}. Director/continuity precedence is respected: for each (s_prev, s_next) in P, Start_{s_next} is at least Start_{s_prev} + dur_{s_prev}. For each actor and day, exactly one first scene and exactly one last scene are selected when the actor is called: the sums of r_{a,d,s} and of q_{a,d,s} over scenes requiring a both equal y_{a,d}. Call and wrap times are bound to those selections via big‑M: for all scenes s requiring a on day d, S_{a,d} equals the start time of the scene with r_{a,d,s}=1 and E_{a,d} equals the end time of the scene with q_{a,d,s}=1, enforced by S_{a,d}  >=  Start_s − M(1 − r_{a,d,s}), S_{a,d}  <=  Start_s + M(1 − r_{a,d,s}), E_{a,d}  >=  Start_s + dur_s − M(1 − q_{a,d,s}), and E_{a,d}  <=  Start_s + dur_s + M(1 − q_{a,d,s}). Idle time is computed conservatively and kept nonnegative: for each actor a and day d, W_{a,d} is at least E_{a,d} minus S_{a,d} minus the total duration of scenes requiring a that are scheduled that day, and W_{a,d}  >=  0. Overtime/meal‑penalty proxy is also conservative and nonnegative: for each actor and day, o_{a,d} is at least the total duration scheduled for that actor that day minus H_a, and o_{a,d}  >=  0. Finally, location usage is triggered by assignments: if any scene that uses location l is scheduled on day d, then u_{l,d}=1 (i.e., u_{l,d}  >=  x_{s,d,t} for all such scenes and slots).\n",

The decision variables are: x[i,j,k]  in  {0,1}, equal to 1 if cell (i,j) is occupied by a vessel of class k; y[u,v,k]  in  {0,1}, equal to 1 if a multi-cell platform of class k is anchored at cell (u,v); and u[p]  >=  0, a slack variable representing the unexplained portion of sensor return p. The objective is to minimize the total misfit cost consisting of the weighted slack for unexplained returns and the placement costs, i.e., minimize ∑_p w[p] * u[p] + ∑_{i,j,k} c[i,j,k] * x[i,j,k].\n",

Optionally, association-graph variables z[i,j]  in  {0,1} for C[i,j] = 1 may be used and tied to x to enforce clique consistency. The objective is to maximize total compatibility-weighted matched structure while penalizing mismatch slack: maximize the sum of w_node[i,j] x[i,j] over all i  in  V1, j  in  V2, plus the sum of w_edge[i1,i2,j1,j2] y[i1,i2,j1,j2] over all i1 < i2  in  V1, j1 < j2  in  V2, minus  lambda  times the sum of s[i1,i2,j1,j2], where  lambda   >=  0.\n",

The selection must satisfy the following constraints. Weight cap: the total weight of selected items is at most Wmax. Practicality: the total item count N equals the sum of selected items and does not exceed Kmax. Category coverage: at least one navigation item is included by requiring xmap + xcompass  >=  1; at least one hydration item is selected (the sum of xi over Ihydration is at least one); at least one nutrition item is selected (sum over Ifood at least one); at least one sun protection item is selected (sum over Isun at least one); and at least one insulation item is selected (sum over Iinsulation at least one). Incompatibility: for every mutually exclusive pair (i, j) in P, at most one of the two items can be selected (xi + xj  <=  1). Synergy linkage for map–compass: ynav_pair can be 1 only if both map and compass are selected, enforced by ynav_pair  <=  xmap, ynav_pair  <=  xcompass, and ynav_pair  >=  xmap + xcompass − 1. Worst‑case utility definition: for every scenario s, η is no greater than the total utility realized in that scenario by the selected items (η  <=  the sum over i of ui,s xi). Safety floors: for every scenario s, the total safety contribution of selected items meets or exceeds Amins (the sum over i of ai,s xi  >=  Amins).

      "The following constraints must hold. Each customer is served exactly once: across all vehicles and outgoing arcs from that customer, the total equals one. For every vehicle and customer, flow is conserved: the number of arcs leaving the customer equals the number entering it. Each vehicle departs its assigned depot exactly once to some customer and returns exactly once from a customer to that depot, so routes start and end at the depot. Time propagation obeys travel and service: for any vehicle and distinct nodes i and j, if arc (i,j) is traversed then the arrival time at j is at least the arrival at i plus service at i plus travel time t_{i,j} (with a big-M relaxation when the arc is not used); each customer’s arrival time lies within its time window [open_i, close_i]. Load propagation mirrors service: for any vehicle and distinct nodes i and j, if arc (i,j) is traversed then the load upon arrival at j equals the load at i minus the demand at j (enforced via big-M upper and lower bounds), loads are bounded 0  <=  load_{k,i}  <=  cap_k at all visited nodes and the depot, and each vehicle starts at its depot with full capacity load_{k,depot_k} = cap_k. Subtours are eliminated using MTZ sequencing: for any vehicle and distinct customers i and j, if arc (i,j) is used then the order index of j is at least that of i plus one, and all order indices lie between 1 and |V|. Driver shifts and overtime satisfy o_k  >=  e_k − s_k − shift_max_k and e_k − s_k  <=  shift_max_k + o_k for each vehicle, and if a customer is visited by vehicle k then its arrival time falls within the driver’s shift window [s_k, e_k]. The synthetic RNG stream is validated by 0  <=  g_t  <=  cap_rng for all t and preservation of pairwise sums: for each t = 1..T−1, g_t + g_{t+1} equals r_t + r_{t+1}; customer demands are set by the mapping d_i = g_{φ(i)} for all customers.\n",

Usage accounting: u[s] equals the number of grid cells labeled s; u_row[r][s] equals the number of occurrences of symbol s in row r; u_col[c][s] equals the number of occurrences of symbol s in column c. Global symbol balance: letting q = floor(N^2 / B) and r = N^2 mod B, each u[s] is either q or q+1, the sum over s of u[s] equals N^2, and exactly r symbols take value q+1. Row and column balances: for every row r and symbol s, u_row[r][s] is between floor(N / B) and ceil(N / B); for every column c and symbol s, u_col[c][s] is between floor(N / B) and ceil(N / B).

Columns are indexed by K = {1, 2,  ... , Kmax}, with Kmax equal to the largest panel size across clinics. Parameters include presence[c,g] indicating whether clinic c contains at least one assay in group g, pos[c,a] denoting the original within-panel order of assay a in clinic c, h[g] as an optional historical column for group g, lock[g]  in  {0,1} indicating whether h[g] must be enforced, and nonnegative weights alpha[g] and beta[g] controlling penalties for deviating from historical positions and for selecting higher-index columns, respectively. Decision variables are: x[c,a,k]  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if assay a of clinic c is assigned to column k; y[c,k]  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if clinic c occupies column k; z[g,k]  in  {0,1}, which equals 1 if canonical group g is globally assigned to column k; and col[c,a]  in  Z+, the column index of assay a in clinic c derived from x.

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a weekly kidney exchange across a set of incompatible donor–recipient pairs P organized by hospitals H and states S, with a directed compatibility graph G whose arcs pass HLA, PRA, and crossmatch screening. A pre-enumerated set C of simple directed cycles of length at most L_max is available, each cycle representing simultaneous donor nephrectomies and recipient transplants for its participating pairs. Time is discretized into schedulable slots T. For each pair i and cycle c we know whether i participates (a_{i,c}), for each hospital h and cycle c we know the number of surgeries induced there (o_{h,c}), and for each cycle–slot (c, t) we know whether logistics permit execution (AllowedSlot_{c,t}) given donor travel windows and lab timing. Fairness data include the number of recipients by blood group g in each cycle (bBlood_{g,c}) and the number of highly sensitized recipients in each cycle (bSens_{high,c}), with minimum share requirements beta_g and a minimum count Q_high, respectively. Interstate logistics are captured by cross-state involvements per cycle (crossState_{s,c}) and per-state per-slot limits (TravelLimit_{s,t}). Each cycle c has a precomputed value combining transplant count, urgency scores, and fairness bonuses (value_c), as well as penalties for ischemia and residual crossmatch risk (risk_penalty_c) and for travel burden (travel_penalty_c). The decision variables are s_{c,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether cycle c is executed at time slot t, and N  in  Z_+, the total number of transplants scheduled.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Formal Problem Statement: Plan a weekly slitting schedule across multiple converting lines using a vetted catalog of feasible cutting patterns to meet time-phased customer demand for finished widths at minimum total cost. Given sets of slitting lines L, cutting patterns P, finished widths W, and planning periods T, each pattern produces a fixed number of rolls of each width (a[w,p]) per parent roll and is compatible with specific lines (U[l,p]); processing a parent roll of pattern p on line l takes tau[l,p] minutes, and each line has period-specific available time T_avail[l,t] after downtime and maintenance (A[l,t] indicates whether the line can run). Demand D[w,t] for each width and period must be satisfied, starting from initial inventories I[w,0] and backorders B[w,0], while crews per period are limited by Crew[t]. Parent roll availability at the start of each period is R[t], with the option to procure additional parent rolls at cost C_parent; trim waste per parent roll depends on pattern p (C_trim[p]); changeovers incur time via an average setup s_bar[l] and a penalty C_change[l]; holding and backorder costs are H[w] and P_bl[w], respectively. Certain widths are designated rush items W_rush that must be fully satisfied by their due period due[w]. Decision variables are: x[l,p,t] (nonnegative integers) for the number of parent rolls of pattern p processed on line l in period t; b[l,p,t] (binary) indicating whether pattern p is activated on line l in period t; y[l,t] (binary) indicating whether line l is used in period t; c[l,t] (nonnegative integers) for the number of changeovers on line l in period t (approximated as activated patterns minus one if the line runs); I[w,t] and B[w,t] (nonnegative reals) for ending inventory and backorders of width w in period t; and pr[t] (nonnegative integers) for additional parent rolls procured in period t.

Each cell c has available machine hours Cap[c,t] by period t; when a preventive maintenance (PM) event is executed it consumes M[c] machine hours and a PM event incurs a cost c_PM[c].

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a weekly, time-expanded multi-modal movement planning problem over a network of country elevators (origins), crush plants, and export docks (destinations). Time is discretized into periods within the week; movements can occur by truck, rail (unit trains), or barge along mode-feasible arcs. Decision variables include: shipped tons x[i,j,m,t]  >=  0 from node i to node j via mode m in period t; on-hand inventory s[n,t]  >=  0 at node n at the end of period t; the integer number of trucks n_truck[i,j,t]  >=  0 dispatched from i to j in period t; binary unit train dispatches y[k,i,j,t]  in  {0,1} indicating train-set k is loaded at i bound for j in period t; binary barge dispatches z[b,i,j,t]  in  {0,1} indicating barge b is loaded at i bound for j in period t; demurrage proxy dem[j,t]  >=  0 for destination j in period t; shortage short[j,t]  >=  0 capturing unmet demand at destination j in period t; and train commitment shortfall train_short[l]  >=  0 for each committed unit-train lane l. The objective is to minimize total weekly logistics cost: the sum of variable transportation costs over all shipped tons (tariffs, surcharges, switching fees), plus fixed dispatch costs for each unit train and barge departure, plus demurrage penalties, plus penalties for unmet demand and for shortfalls against weekly unit-train commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy: (1) Flow and inventory balance at every node and period: ending inventory equals prior inventory plus exogenous receipts plus all inbound tons across modes minus all outbound tons across modes; initial inventories are given. (2) Inventory bounds: inventories are nonnegative and cannot exceed each node’s storage capacity. (3) Demand satisfaction with allowed shortages: for each destination and period, the sum of inbound tons across modes plus the shortage equals the required pull in that period. (4) Weekly contract minimums: total tons delivered to each contracted destination across all periods and modes must meet or exceed its weekly minimum. (5) Origin load-out capacities: for each origin and period, total tons loaded across all modes cannot exceed its load-out capacity in that period. (6) Destination receive capacities and demurrage: for each destination and period, the demurrage proxy must be at least the amount by which inbound tons exceed the destination’s receive capacity (and otherwise may be zero). (7) Truck-mode linking: truck tons on any arc and period cannot exceed truck payload times the number of trucks dispatched on that arc and period. (8) Truck fleet availability: in each period, the total number of trucks dispatched system-wide cannot exceed the available truck fleet. (9) Rail-mode linking to unit trains: rail tons on any arc and period cannot exceed the sum over dispatched train-sets of their loadable train sizes. (10) Origin rail spot limits: in each period, the number of unit trains loaded at any origin cannot exceed that origin’s track spot capacity. (11) Unit train-set round-trip availability: for each train-set, across any rolling window of length equal to its round-trip cycle time, it can be dispatched (loaded) at most once (i.e., a train-set cannot be simultaneously out on overlapping trips). (12) Barge-mode linking with river draft limits: barge tons on any arc and period cannot exceed the period’s draft-limited barge load multiplied by the number of barges dispatched on that arc and period. (13) Barge fleet occupancy: for each barge, across any rolling window of length equal to its round-trip cycle time, it can be dispatched at most once. (14) Unit-train weekly commitments: for each committed lane, the total number of unit trains dispatched over the week on that lane, plus a nonnegative shortfall variable, must meet or exceed the committed number of trains. (15) Mode/arc feasibility: shipped tons are zero on arcs that are infeasible for a given mode. (16) Domains: continuous variables are nonnegative, truck counts are nonnegative integers, and train/barge dispatch indicators are binary.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize total weekly logistics cost = sum of lane variable costs (tariffs + fuel surcharges + switching) times shipped tons + fixed dispatch costs for trains and barges + demurrage/layover penalties + penalties for unmet demand and shortfalls against unit-train commitments.\n",
      "Expected Output: An executable weekly movement plan: for each period, lane, and mode, the tons to move (x[i,j,m,t]); train and barge dispatches (y[k,i,j,t], z[b,i,j,t]) with assigned origins/destinations; number of truckloads by arc and period (n_truck[i,j,t]); projected end-of-period inventories (s[n,t]); anticipated demurrage (dem[j,t]) and any shortages (short[j,t]); shortfalls against train commitments (train_short[l]); and a cost breakdown by component (variable transport, fixed dispatch, demurrage, shortage, commitment penalties).\n",

For each segment s and time t: the illuminance E_{s,t} (nonnegative) and split variables e_plus_{s,t} and e_minus_{s,t} (both nonnegative) that represent the absolute deviation of E_{s,t} from a target R_{s,t}. System-wide variables include the total electrical demand P_t at each time t (nonnegative) and the peak demand P_peak over the horizon (nonnegative), and for each glare monitoring point m and time t a nonnegative glare slack g_slack_{m,t}. The objective is to minimize the sum of safety-weighted absolute illuminance deviations across segments and times, w_s * (e_plus_{s,t} + e_minus_{s,t}); plus the time-of-use energy cost, sum over t of c_t * P_t * Delta_t; plus the demand charge C_demand * P_peak; plus a penalty on glare slack, gamma_glare * sum over m,t of g_slack_{m,t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constraints enforce physics, policy, and operational limits. Illuminance synthesis: for each segment s and time t, E_{s,t} equals the contribution from all luminaires via the influence coefficients A_{s,l} times their luminous flux, plus ambient illuminance, i.e., E_{s,t} = sum_{l in L} A_{s,l} * Phi_{l,t} + E_amb_{s,t}. Local LED linearization: for each luminaire l and time t, luminous flux is an affine function of dimming, Phi_{l,t} = alpha_l * d_{l,t} + beta_l. Absolute-deviation linking: for each segment s and time t, E_{s,t} − R_{s,t} = e_plus_{s,t} − e_minus_{s,t}, with e_plus_{s,t}  >=  0 and e_minus_{s,t}  >=  0. Regulatory compliance band: for each segment s and time t, illuminance must lie within mandated bounds, Lmin_s  <=  E_{s,t}  <=  Lmax_s. Per-lamp dimming bounds: for each luminaire l and time t, dmin_l  <=  d_{l,t}  <=  dmax_l, and curfew caps impose d_{l,t}  <=  U_{l,t}. Glare limits with slack: for each monitoring point m and time t, the glare contribution sum_{l in L} G_{m,l} * Phi_{l,t} must not exceed Gbar_m plus slack, i.e.,  <=  Gbar_m + g_slack_{m,t}, with g_slack_{m,t}  >=  0. Ramp-rate (anti-flicker): for each luminaire l and consecutive times t = 2, ... ,|T|, the change in dimming is limited by r_l, i.e., d_{l,t} − d_{l,t−1}  <=  r_l and d_{l,t−1} − d_{l,t}  <=  r_l. Demand accumulation: for each time t, total electrical demand is the sum of per-luminaire power contributions, P_t = sum_{l in L} kappa_l * Phi_{l,t}. Peak-demand definition: P_peak is at least the demand in every interval, P_peak  >=  P_t for all t. The problem seeks the optimal dimming schedule and associated fluxes and illuminance predictions that satisfy all constraints while minimizing the stated objective.\n",

Time feasibility on continuous units: the sum of run hours implied by production (production divided by the unit’s effective line rate), plus changeover hours, plus any scheduled maintenance block hours, must not exceed the calendar hours available in the month for each unit. Time feasibility on batch reactors: the sum of batch cycle hours (cycle time times batch count), plus changeover hours, plus any scheduled maintenance block hours, must not exceed the calendar hours available in the month for each reactor. Inventory balances hold by product and month: end-of-month inventory equals prior month’s inventory plus production from all continuous units and reactors (reactor yields times batch counts), minus shipments. Backlog evolves by product and month as prior backlog plus demand minus shipments, and backlog must remain nonnegative. Monthly feedstock quotas must be respected: total feed consumption across continuous production (consumption coefficients per ton times production) and reactor batches (consumption coefficients per batch times batch counts) cannot exceed each feedstock’s monthly quota. Outbound capacity is limited: total shipments across products in each month cannot exceed the month’s loading capacity; service levels are enforced by product and month via a minimum shipment floor equal to a specified fraction of demand. Tank farm limits apply: end-of-month inventory by product cannot exceed its storage capacity, and the sum of inventories over all products assigned to a tank group cannot exceed that group’s capacity. Labor feasibility is split by function: operations labor hours used (continuous-unit run hours plus reactor cycle hours plus changeover hours) cannot exceed productive hours per operations crew times the number of operations crews plus any overtime; maintenance labor hours used (maintenance block hours across assets) cannot exceed productive hours per maintenance crew times the number of maintenance crews. Total crews assigned in a month are capped by the enterprise crew cap, and overtime hours are limited by the union overtime cap. Binary production linking is enforced: production or batch counts on an asset-product-month are bounded above by a large constant times the corresponding production indicator, ensuring consistency between continuous decisions and binary activity flags. Changeovers are linked across months: for each asset and product, in months after the initial month, the changeover indicator must be at least the increase in the asset’s production indicator for that product relative to the prior month, thereby requiring a changeover whenever a new product begins; changeover variables are binary.

For each link e and time t, u[e,t] is the utilization fraction (nonnegative, continuous) and sl[e,t] is the slack above a utilization threshold (nonnegative, continuous). For each transit or IX provider q and time t, flow[q,t] is the egress traffic (nonnegative, continuous), billed[q] is the 95th-percentile billing peak (nonnegative, continuous), and s[q,t] is a binary selector indicating whether interval t is among the discarded top 5% for provider q. For each commodity k and interval t, drop[k,t] is the unmet demand (nonnegative, continuous) used only to ensure feasibility under extreme conditions, and OPEX is an auxiliary nonnegative variable equal to the total monthly cost being minimized.

Path splitting limit: for every commodity, the number of enabled SR paths does not exceed its splitting limit. Latency SLA via big-M: for every commodity and path, the path’s end-to-end latency must be at most the commodity’s SLA if the path is enabled; otherwise the constraint is relaxed when y is zero. SR feasibility mask: for every commodity and path, the path can be enabled only if it is marked feasible by the SR policy mask. Transit egress flow definition: for every provider and interval, the provider’s egress traffic equals the sum of routed bandwidth on links that egress to that provider in that interval. 95th-percentile billing linearization: for every provider and interval, billed[q] is at least the egress flow in any non-discarded interval and may be relaxed by the big-M term when that interval is marked as discarded; and, for every provider, exactly m95 intervals are marked as discarded to implement the 95th-percentile rule. Utilization definition and slack: for every link and interval, utilization equals aggregate carried traffic divided by nominal capacity, and slack is constrained to be at least the excess of utilization over its threshold. An optional monthly budget cap requires OPEX to be no greater than the budget B. Finally, OPEX is defined to equal the sum of all cost components described above, and the optimization minimizes OPEX subject to all constraints and variable domain requirements.\n",

      "Title: Lean Headcount Optimization for 24/7 Water Treatment Cyclic Rosters\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: A municipal water treatment utility must design a lean, cyclic staffing plan for multiple treatment lines operated across daily shifts over a full year. Demand D_{l,s,t} specifies the required number of operators for each line l in the set L, shift s in the set S, and day t in the set T. Staffing is built exclusively from a pre-validated set of allowed cyclic roster patterns P_allowed, each with cycle length H, and employees may start at any offset r in the set R. For each pattern p and offset r, the availability matrix A_{p,r,s,t} indicates whether an employee works shift s on day t within the repeating cycle. Operators come in skill grades K, with a subset K_high meeting regulatory credential requirements; a qualification matrix q_{k,l} indicates which grades can operate each line l. The decision variables are x_{p,k,r} (nonnegative integers), the number of employees of skill grade k  in  K assigned to pattern p  in  P_allowed with start offset r  in  R, and z_k (nonnegative integers), the total hires of grade k defined by z_k = ∑_{p in P_allowed} ∑_{r in R} x_{p,k,r}. Annual labor cost per hire of grade k is c_k. Regulatory audits impose minimum credentialed coverage G_{l,s,t} per line, shift, and day; fatigue and union guarantees impose limits through NightShifts_p (the number of night shifts per cycle in pattern p), OffDays_p (off-duty days per cycle in pattern p), a maximum allowed night-shift fraction  theta _night, and a minimum off-duty days per cycle OffMin. An optional budget cap Budget_max may be imposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective is to minimize the total annual labor cost ∑_{k in K} c_k z_k while exactly meeting coverage and complying with all rules. Coverage constraints require that for every line l, shift s, and day t, the sum of available, qualified assigned employees meets or exceeds demand: ∑_{p in P_allowed} ∑_{k in K} ∑_{r in R} A_{p,r,s,t}  *  q_{k,l}  *  x_{p,k,r}  >=  D_{l,s,t}.

Headcount is defined by z_k = ∑_{p in P_allowed} ∑_{r in R} x_{p,k,r} for each k  in  K. A night-shift fatigue cap enforces that the average number of night shifts per full-time equivalent per cycle does not exceed  theta _night  *  H, i.e., ∑_{p in P_allowed} ∑_{k in K} ∑_{r in R} NightShifts_p  *  x_{p,k,r}  <=   theta _night  *  H  *  ∑_{p in P_allowed} ∑_{k in K} ∑_{r in R} x_{p,k,r}.

      "Formal Problem Statement: Over a planning horizon of T discrete weeks, a single bottleneck machining cell produces a set S of SKUs that are partitioned across product lines L, where L(l) denotes the SKUs on line l. Each SKU s has selling price p_s, material cost m_s, and pre- and post-retrofit cycle times ct_pre_s and ct_post_s (with ct_post_s  <=  ct_pre_s). Weekly available machine hours from scheduled shifts are H_shift_t. A one-time retrofit, if scheduled in week t, consumes H_up machine hours that week and requires an upfront cash payment P_upfront; thereafter (from the start of the following week), post-retrofit cycle times apply. Payroll costs accrue at w per machine hour. Weekly demand caps D_{s,t} and total minimum commitments Cmin_s are given. For each line l, a fraction κ_l of that line’s weekly revenue must be carved out into a segregated reserve account, and service obligations SvcDue_{l,t} must be paid from that reserve. Initial cash and reserve balances B_0 and R_{l,0} are given, as is a minimum cash safety floor B_min. Decision variables are, for each SKU s and week t, total production x_{s,t}  >=  0 split into x_pre_{s,t}  >=  0 (processed with pre-retrofit cycle time) and x_post_{s,t}  >=  0 (processed with post-retrofit cycle time); for each week t, y_t  in  {0,1} indicates whether the retrofit is scheduled that week (at most once in the horizon), and U_t  in  {0,1} indicates whether the retrofit has been completed by the start of week t; h_t  >=  0 is total machine hours used in week t; B_t  >=  0 is the end-of-week cash balance; for each line l and week t, Rev_{l,t}  >=  0 is the revenue attributed to line l, R_{l,t}  >=  0 is the end-of-week reserve balance, and u_{l,t}  >=  0 is the reserve outflow for that line.

For each SKU s and week t, total production splits as x_{s,t} = x_pre_{s,t} + x_post_{s,t}. To enforce pre/post activation around the retrofit using a sufficiently large bound M_s, for all s,t we require x_post_{s,t}  <=  M_s U_t (post-processing only allowed once the upgrade has been completed) and x_pre_{s,t}  <=  M_s (1 − U_t) (pre-processing only allowed before completion). The retrofit can be scheduled at most once: ∑_t y_t  <=  1; the upgrade state follows U_1 = 0 and, for t = 2, ... ,T, U_t = U_{t−1} + y_{t−1}, so that the state switches on starting the week after the scheduled retrofit. For all s,t, production is demand-feasible, 0  <=  x_{s,t}  <=  D_{s,t}, and for all s, minimum commitments are met, ∑_{t=1}^T x_{s,t}  >=  Cmin_s.

Transmission capacity with reliability margin: each directed flow is bounded by the derated thermal limit, 0  <=  f[i,j,t]  <=  (1–Alpha[t]) * U[i,j]. Generator capacity and availability: unit outputs respect minimum and maximum limits when on, Pmin[u] * y[u,t]  <=  g[u,t]  <=  Pmax[u] * y[u,t], and a unit may only be on if available, y[u,t]  <=  Aavail[u,t].

      "Formal Problem Statement: We seek a weekly, finite-horizon mixed-integer linear plan that decides, for each period, which bulk intermediates to run on each reactor and which finished SKUs to run on each packaging line, together with quantities, changeovers, inventory flows with shelf-life, shipments, backlog, overtime, and external buys. Decision variables are: bulk production x_{b,r,t} (nonnegative continuous, tons) of intermediate b on reactor r in period t; reactor assignment yR_{b,r,t} (binary) indicating reactor r runs b in t; reactor changeover zR_{i,j,r,t} (binary) indicating reactor r changes from bulk i at t−1 to j at t; packaged quantity u_{k,p,t} (nonnegative continuous, units) of SKU k on packaging line p in t; packaging assignment vP_{k,p,t} (binary) indicating line p runs k in t; packaging changeover zP_{i,j,p,t} (binary) indicating line p changes from SKU i at t−1 to j at t; end-of-period bulk inventory bulkinv_{b,t} (nonnegative continuous); end-of-period finished-goods inventory by age inv_{k,a,t} for age a = 1, ... ,L_k (nonnegative continuous); shipments ship_{k,a,t} from age a in t (nonnegative continuous); expired scrappage scrap_{k,t} (nonnegative continuous); end-of-period backlog back_{k,t} (nonnegative continuous); external purchase buy_{k,t} (nonnegative continuous); and overtime hours otR_{r,t} and otP_{p,t} on reactors and packaging lines (nonnegative continuous, bounded). The objective is to maximize total contribution margin over the horizon, equal to revenue from shipments of each SKU (price times shipped) minus the sum of variable reactor production costs, variable packaging costs, reactor and packaging setup costs, external purchase costs, finished-goods holding costs, reactor and packaging overtime costs, backlog penalty costs, and scrap costs.\n",

      "The plan must satisfy: for each reactor and period, processing hours for bulk production plus changeover hours do not exceed base available hours plus overtime; for each packaging line and period, packaging hours for SKUs plus changeover hours do not exceed base available hours plus overtime. At most one product may be run per reactor per period and at most one SKU per packaging line per period. Lot sizes are linked to assignments: for each bulk b on reactor r and period t, production is zero unless assigned and, if assigned, must lie between the minimum and maximum feasible batch sizes; for each SKU k on packaging line p and period t, packaged quantity is zero unless assigned and, if assigned, must lie between the minimum and maximum feasible run sizes. Changeovers are activated logically: for each reactor r, period t, and distinct bulk i and j, the corresponding changeover variable must be on whenever the reactor ran i in t−1 and runs j in t; analogously for each packaging line p and distinct SKUs i and j. Bulk inventory balances each period: next-period bulk inventory equals current bulk inventory plus total bulk produced across reactors minus total bulk consumed by packaging, where consumption follows the bill of materials coefficients. Finished goods flow by age: for each SKU and period, next-period youngest-age inventory equals total packaged plus external buys minus shipments from the youngest age; for each intermediate age bucket a, next-period inventory in age a+1 equals current inventory in age a minus shipments from age a; expiry is enforced by setting scrap equal to the ending inventory in the oldest age bucket minus shipments from that bucket. Shipments from each SKU age bucket each period are limited by the on-hand inventory in that bucket. Demand and backlog satisfy, for each SKU and period, that total shipments across all ages plus end-of-period backlog equals demand plus prior-period backlog. Each SKU’s service level (fill rate) is enforced by bounding the aggregate backlog over the horizon to be no more than the allowed fraction of total demand. Warehouse capacity is respected each period: the sum of storage volume across all SKUs and age buckets does not exceed the warehouse capacity.

      "Formal Problem Statement: A multi-site manufacturing firm must plan staffing, training, and hour assignments across plants p, production lines l  in  L_p, primary skills s, and discrete time periods t to meet line-hour requirements while minimizing total cost. Decision variables include: x_{p,s,t} (nonnegative integers) for on-payroll headcount by plant and skill; h_{p,l,s,t} (nonnegative) for productive hours of workers with primary skill s allocated to line l; o_{p,s,t} (nonnegative) for overtime hours; idle_{p,s,t} (nonnegative) for paid but idle hours; y_{p,s,t} (nonnegative integers) for training starts; g_{p,s,t} (nonnegative) for training completions; hires_{p,s,t} and sep_{p,s,t} (nonnegative integers) for external hires and separations; z_under_{p,l,t} and z_over_{p,l,t} (nonnegative) for under-coverage and over-coverage slacks on each line; x_eff_{p,l,t} (nonnegative) for effective skilled hours driving waste; lambda_{p,l,t,k} (nonnegative) as convex combination weights over waste-curve breakpoints k  in  K_l; W_{p,l,t} (nonnegative) for waste/disposal cost on each line; Spend_t (nonnegative) for total controllable spend per period; and y_finance_t  in  {0,1} for whether finance sign-off is invoked in period t. The objective is to minimize, over the planning horizon, the sum of base wage costs (implied by regular paid hours per head), overtime costs, training start costs, hiring costs, separation/redundancy costs, line-level waste/disposal costs evaluated via calibrated piecewise-linear curves, penalty costs for under-coverage and over-coverage, and any administrative or risk cost associated with finance sign-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints for all relevant indices. Workforce balance: headcount evolves as x_{p,s,t} = x_{p,s,t-1} + hires_{p,s,t} + g_{p,s,t} − sep_{p,s,t} for t > 1. Training pipeline: completions follow lead-time incidence, g_{p,s,t} equals the sum over start periods u of Atrain_{s,u,t} times y_{p,s,u}. Hours conservation: for each plant and skill, the sum of line-assigned productive hours plus idle hours equals regular paid hours plus overtime, namely ∑_{l in L_p} h_{p,l,s,t} + idle_{p,s,t} = H_s  *  x_{p,s,t} + o_{p,s,t}. Overtime cap: o_{p,s,t}  <=  cap_ot_{p,s}  *  x_{p,s,t}.

Effective hours for waste: x_eff_{p,l,t} = ∑_{s} beta_{l,s}  *  h_{p,l,s,t}. Piecewise-linear waste cost evaluation via convex combination: the convex weights sum to one, ∑_{k in K_l} lambda_{p,l,t,k} = 1; effective hours are the convex combination of breakpoints, x_eff_{p,l,t} = ∑_{k in K_l} R_{l,k}  *  lambda_{p,l,t,k}; and waste cost equals the corresponding convex combination, W_{p,l,t} = ∑_{k in K_l} C_{p,l,t,k}  *  lambda_{p,l,t,k}. Recruiting and redundancy capacities: hires_{p,s,t}  <=  cap_hire_{p,s,t} and sep_{p,s,t}  <=  cap_sep_{p,s,t}. Finance budget governance: total controllable spend per period equals the sum of wage and overtime costs, training/hiring/separation costs, line penalty and waste costs, and any sign-off cost, i.e., Spend_t = ∑_{p,s} (c_wage_{p,s}  *  H_s  *  x_{p,s,t} + c_ot_{p,s}  *  o_{p,s,t}) + ∑_{p,s} (c_train_{p,s}  *  y_{p,s,t} + c_hire_{p,s}  *  hires_{p,s,t} + c_sep_{p,s}  *  sep_{p,s,t}) + ∑_{p}∑_{l in L_p} (c_under_{p,l,t}  *  z_under_{p,l,t} + c_over_{p,l,t}  *  z_over_{p,l,t} + W_{p,l,t}) + c_signoff_t  *  y_finance_t; and Spend_t must not exceed the baseline threshold unless sign-off is invoked, Spend_t  <=  B_t + DeltaB_t  *  y_finance_t.

Given observations i in I with measured pressures p_i and deflections y_i, robust weights w_i, a set of production batches Batches with a mapping batch(i) from each observation to its batch, certification pressure levels j in J with pressures P_cert_j, nominal allowable deflections D_allow_j, and tolerance bands T_j, a monotonicity grid S_mono over the tested pressure range, bounds c_min  <=  c  <=  c_max and b_min  <=  b  <=  b_max, a maximum batch-offset magnitude O_max, and regularization weights  lambda _o and  lambda _c, choose real-valued decision variables: a (global intercept), b (linear coefficient), c (quadratic curvature), batch offsets o_B for each B in Batches, residuals r_i and absolute residuals e_i for each i in I, certification absolute deviations t_j for each j in J, absolute-value proxies oabs_B for each batch offset, and cabs for c. The objective is to minimize the robust and regularized loss ∑_{i in I} w_i * e_i +  lambda _o * ∑_{B in Batches} oabs_B +  lambda _c * cabs.\n",

      "The model is constrained as follows. For every observation i in I, define the residual by r_i = y_i − (a + b * p_i + c * p_i^2 + o_{batch(i)}), and linearize its absolute value by enforcing e_i  >=  r_i and e_i  >=  −r_i. At each certification level j in J, define the absolute deviation from the nominal allowable deflection by t_j  >=  (a + b * P_cert_j + c * P_cert_j^2) − D_allow_j and t_j  >=  −[(a + b * P_cert_j + c * P_cert_j^2) − D_allow_j], and enforce the tolerance t_j  <=  T_j. Impose physical plausibility through curvature and slope bounds c_min  <=  c  <=  c_max and b_min  <=  b  <=  b_max, and constrain each batch offset by −O_max  <=  o_B  <=  O_max for all B in Batches. Enforce monotonicity of deflection with respect to pressure over the tested range by requiring the derivative to be nonnegative on the grid: b + 2 * c * p_k  >=  0 for all p_k in S_mono. Finally, linearize the absolute values used for regularization by imposing oabs_B  >=  o_B and oabs_B  >=  −o_B for all B in Batches, and cabs  >=  c and cabs  >=  −c.\n",

      "Title: Multi-period procurement, inventory, and dual-line blending plan under texture quality and warehouse constraints\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a multi-period planning horizon with months t, suppliers s, two raw categories (produce and feed), and two parallel refining lines (produce line and feed line). The firm chooses, for each supplier and month, nonnegative committed purchase volumes and spot purchase volumes, and a binary activation flag indicating whether a committed agreement is active. It determines end-of-month on-hand inventory by raw category, raw usage by category, and nonnegative line inputs processed on each line. Optionally, a nonnegative sales variable can be included. The objective is to maximize total contribution margin over the horizon: monthly sales revenue (unit selling price times required demand) minus procurement costs (committed and spot purchases), processing costs (per input unit on each line), and inventory carrying costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints each month. Inventory balances by category: end-of-month inventory equals last month’s inventory plus arrivals of orders placed L_s months earlier from suppliers that supply that category (arrivals are zero if the lead time would place them before the start of the horizon), minus category usage; beginning inventory is given. Line-category mapping: produce usage equals the input processed on the produce line, and feed usage equals the input processed on the feed line. Warehouse capacity: the sum of inventory volumes across categories, using category-specific unit volumes, cannot exceed the available warehouse capacity. Line capacity: each line’s input processed cannot exceed its monthly capacity. Demand satisfaction: the total output (yield times input on each line) must meet or exceed the month’s demand; alternatively, if a sales variable is used, set sales equal to demand and constrain sales not to exceed the total output. Texture quality bounds: the blend’s texture index, computed via the linearized relation that the sum of texture coefficients times line outputs lies between the lower and upper bound times total output, must remain within required limits. Commitment activation: if a supplier’s committed agreement is active in a month, the committed volume must be at least the supplier-specific minimum and no more than the supplier-specific maximum; if not active, the committed volume is zero. Spot purchases are limited by supplier-specific monthly maxima. Monthly cash budgets: total cash used for procurement (committed and spot), processing on both lines, and inventory carrying costs cannot exceed the available cash budget. All purchase, inventory, usage, processing, and sales variables are nonnegative, and commitment activation variables are binary.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: A central counterparty (CCP) considers K stress scenarios with calibrated probabilities p_k (nonnegative and summing to 1) and only limited portfolio information: the first raw moment mu = E[Z] and the second raw moment m2 = E[Z^2] of the portfolio loss Z. For each scenario k, the portfolio loss z_k must lie within given bounds L_k_min  <=  z_k  <=  L_k_max and respect a stress-severity ordering r_k (nondecreasing losses with increasing severity). The CCP seeks distribution-agnostic lower and upper bounds on the fourth central moment M4 = E[(Z − mu)^4] by solving two linear programs over a common feasible region: (i) minimize and (ii) maximize the weighted sum ∑_k p_k t_k, where t_k is a convex piecewise-linear over-estimator of (z_k − mu)^4. The piecewise-linear envelopes use fixed breakpoint sets: Q_breakpoints = {q_j} for z^2 and R_breakpoints = {r_j} for d^4, with tangents defined by slopes and intercepts (alpha_j = 2 q_j, beta_j = − q_j^2) for z^2 and (gamma_j = 4 r_j^3, eta_j = −3 r_j^4) for d^4.\n",

The feasible region is defined by: (1) the first-moment matching constraint ∑_k p_k z_k = mu; (2) the second-moment matching constraint ∑_k p_k y_k = m2; (3) the centering relations d_k = z_k − mu for all k; (4) scenario bounds L_k_min  <=  z_k  <=  L_k_max for all k; (5) stress-severity monotonicity z_i  <=  z_j for all ordered pairs (i, j) with r_i  <=  r_j; (6) for every scenario k and every breakpoint q_j, the quadratic outer-approximation inequalities y_k  >=  alpha_j z_k + beta_j; and (7) for every scenario k and every breakpoint r_j, the quartic outer-approximation inequalities t_k  >=  gamma_j d_k + eta_j.

Transport capacity coupling: total shipments in a month cannot exceed the tonnage implied by scheduled railcars and barge tows, ∑d ∑q y[d,q,t]  <=  RailCarCap * r[t] + BargeTowCap * b[t]. Contracts: each contract’s required volume must be delivered within its allowed window, ∑t in Window(j) ∑q y[d(j),q,t]  >=  V[j]; and shipments to a contract’s destination outside its delivery window are forbidden via a big-M constraint, ∑q y[d(j),q,t]  <=  Mj * A[j,t], where A[j,t] equals 1 if t is in the contract’s window and 0 otherwise.

Each unit i in U is an axis-aligned rectangle with base dimensions (length L_i, width W_i) and weight WGT_i, to be placed within deck extents [0, X_max]  times  [0, Y_max] on a lashing grid with spacings Gx and Gy. Certain ordered pairs (i, j) in a set S must satisfy hazardous-material segregation buffers that differ by longitudinal and transverse directions and may be reduced if a certified physical barrier between i and j is present. The deck contains rectangular firefighting/no-go lanes with known bounds that stowage must clear, and the deck is partitioned into weight zones with given rectangular bounds and capacities. The vessel’s allowable longitudinal and transverse center-of-gravity windows are given. Units are assigned to discharge stops deststop_i on a route indexed s = 1, ... ,S_max, and the outboard edge for crane access is specified as either the south (low-y) or north (high-y) side; an outboard offset ε_seq is required to ensure earlier stops are more outboard than later stops.

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider an annual planning problem for a mining company operating a set of pits feeding several processing plants to serve multiple customers over a discrete set of time periods. For each pit, a finite set of feasible run plans is given, each specifying period-by-period ore availability, grades, and mining effort. The decision variables are: (i) y_{p,r}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether run plan r is selected for pit p (exactly one per pit must be chosen); (ii) v_{p,r,m,c,t}  >=  0, the tonnes in period t that originate from pit p under run plan r, are processed at plant m, and shipped to customer c; (iii) q_{c,s,t}  >=  0, the portion of customer c’s total period‑t shipments assigned to royalty tier s; and (iv) z_{c,s,t}  in  {0,1}, a tier‑activation variable to enforce stepwise filling of royalty tiers. Effective shipped quality for each attribute k is plant‑specific and given for any flow by G^{eff}_{p,r,m,t,k}.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective is to maximize total contribution margin over all periods. Revenue equals the base price per tonne for each customer and period plus linear quality premia/penalties determined by the realized delivered attributes; costs include variable mining costs applied to the ore tonnages implied by the selected run plans, variable processing costs by plant and period, logistics/handling costs from plants to customers, and royalties computed from the tiered per‑tonne rates applied to the volume assigned to each activated royalty tier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints. Exactly one run plan is selected for each pit: the binary run‑plan choices sum to one per pit. Mining‑to‑sales balance enforces that, in each period, total tonnes routed from a pit under a selected run plan across all plants and customers do not exceed that run plan’s available ore for the period. Plant throughput capacity limits the total tonnes processed at each plant in each period. A workforce‑hours cap applies in every period: the sum of processing hours (per‑tonne processing hours at each plant multiplied by processed tonnes) plus mining hours (per‑tonne mining hours for each pit–run‑plan–period multiplied by that run plan’s ore availability and activated only if the run plan is selected) must not exceed available labor hours. Customer offtake bounds require that, for each customer and period, total shipped tonnes lie between the contractual minimum and maximum. Quality certification imposes, for each customer, period, and each attribute with a minimum requirement, that the weighted average delivered attribute across all contributing pit–run plan–plant flows meets or exceeds the specified floor; similarly, for attributes with maximum limits, the weighted average must not exceed the specified ceiling. Royalty accounting links volumes so that, for each customer and period, total shipments equal the sum of volumes assigned to their royalty tiers; tier volumes are bounded by each tier’s width and can be positive only if the corresponding tier is activated, and tier‑activation variables are ordered to ensure lower tiers are filled before higher ones. Plant ramping constraints limit period‑to‑period changes in throughput at each plant to lie within a symmetric ramp‑up/ramp‑down bound (for all periods after the first).

      "Formal Problem Statement: Consider a multi-period mixed-integer linear optimization over a set of currencies I (with home currency h), venues V grouped by jurisdictions J, subsidiaries U, intra-day time buckets T (with final bucket T_end), and swap tenors Tau. Given spot rates and forward adjustments, starting balances, subsidiary contributions and buffers, per-ticket caps and ticket maxima, venue capacities and settlement-window indicators, jurisdictional daily notional limits and transaction quotas, fee parameters (base rates, venue-specific surcharges, tier thresholds), net sweep capacities, and big-M constants with appropriate bounds, choose decision variables: x[i,k,v,t]  >=  0 as the amount of spot conversion from currency i to currency k executed at venue v in time bucket t; w[i,k,v, tau ,t]  >=  0 as the notional of a swap from currency i to currency k initiated at venue v in time bucket t with tenor  tau  (second leg at t+ tau ); y[v,t]  in  {0,1} indicating whether venue v is used in time bucket t; n[i,v,t]  in  Z+ as the number of tickets used for currency i at venue v in time bucket t; b[i,t]  >=  0 as the end-of-bucket balance of currency i at time t; s[i,u,t]  >=  0 as the sweep collected from subsidiary u in currency i at time t; e[i,t]  >=  0 as the total execution fee in currency i at time t; g[i,v,t]  >=  0 capturing flow above the fee threshold  theta [i,v] for piecewise linear fees; F[i,t]  >=  0 as the total outbound flow from currency i at time t; and H  >=  0 as the end-of-day headroom in the home currency.

      "The constraints are as follows. Balance dynamics: for each currency and each time bucket except the final, the next-bucket balance equals the current balance plus sweeps, plus inflows from spot conversions into that currency and maturing swap legs, minus outflows from spot conversions out of that currency and initiated swap legs, minus fees. Headroom definition and minimum: H equals the home-currency balance at the final bucket and must be at least the required minimum. Outbound flow definition: for each currency and time bucket, F equals the sum of spot conversions out of the currency and swaps initiated out of the currency in that bucket.

Settlement cutoffs: for each source currency, venue, and time bucket, the combined spot and swap initiation out of that currency at that venue and time cannot exceed the settlement-window availability indicator times its big-M gate; if the indicator is zero, execution is disallowed. Jurisdictional compliance thresholds: for each jurisdiction, the total daily executed notional across all venues in that jurisdiction (summing both spot and swaps over all currencies and time buckets) must not exceed the jurisdictional limit. Jurisdictional transaction quotas: the total count of venue usages y across all venues and time buckets within a jurisdiction must not exceed its transaction quota. Venue usage linking: for each venue and time bucket, executed spot and swap flow must be zero unless the venue is marked used (y=1), and when used the aggregate flow is limited by its big-M gate. Venue capacity: for each venue and time bucket, the total executed flow cannot exceed the venue’s capacity. Swap leg consistency: for any swap from currency i to k initiated at a venue and time with tenor  tau , the inbound conversion from k to i at the maturity bucket must be at least the swap notional, ensuring the second leg is executed. Piecewise linear fees: for each currency and time bucket, fees must be at least the base proportional fee rate times the outbound flow plus, for each venue, the venue-specific surcharge applied to the portion of outbound flow above the venue’s tier threshold; the auxiliary g variables capture this excess and must be at least the outbound flow minus the threshold and nonnegative. Subsidiary sweep bounds and netting: for each currency, subsidiary, and time bucket, the sweep cannot exceed the availability after buffers and must be nonnegative, and the total sweeps across subsidiaries in a currency at a time cannot exceed the net sweep capacity.

For each discipline k delivering to requirement i, one full-time equivalent (FTE) produces Θ_{k,i} units of output. The planner decides each week and site: a_{k,i,s,t}  >=  0, the FTE of discipline k assigned to requirement i; H_{k,s,t}  >=  0, total available headcount for discipline k; h_perm_{k,s,t}  >=  0 and integer, permanent hires; h_cont_{k,s,t}  >=  0, contingent labor FTE; b_{k,s,t}  >=  0, bench (idle FTE); m_{k,k',s,t}  >=  0, redeployment flow of FTE moved from discipline k′ to k; over_{i,s,t}  >=  0, surplus coverage; short_{i,s,t}  >=  0, shortfall; and y_{i,s,t}  in  {0,1}, a binary indicator that selects surplus (y=1) or shortfall (y=0).

Headcount availability balance: for every discipline k, site s, and week t, the available headcount H_{k,s,t} equals the baseline headcount H_base_{k,s,t} plus permanent hires h_perm_{k,s,t} and contingent labor h_cont_{k,s,t}, plus total redeployed FTE incoming from other disciplines minus total redeployed FTE outgoing to other disciplines. Assignment capacity with bench: for every k, s, t, the total assigned FTE across all requirements, plus bench b_{k,s,t}, cannot exceed available headcount H_{k,s,t}. Utilization guardrails: for every k, s, t, the total assigned FTE must lie between L_{k,s} times H_{k,s,t} and U_{k,s} times H_{k,s,t}, enforcing lower and upper utilization bounds. Recruit throttling: for every k, s, t, permanent hires h_perm_{k,s,t} cannot exceed the recruiting pipeline limit RecruitCap_{k,s,t} and also cannot exceed the weekly ramp limit RampRate_{k,s}. Contingent labor limit: for every k, s, t, contingent labor h_cont_{k,s,t} cannot exceed the contingent capacity ContCap_{k,s,t}.

The decision variables are: x[p,f,t]  >=  0, units of product family p produced at facility f in period t; y[l,f,t]  in  nonnegative integers, workers of labor type l assigned at facility f in period t; o[l,f,t]  >=  0, overtime hours for labor type l at facility f in period t; ct[l1,l2,f,t]  in  nonnegative integers, workers enrolled starting in period t to cross-train from labor type l1 to labor type l2 at facility f; inv[p,f,t]  >=  0, end-of-period inventory of product family p at facility f; ship[p,f,t]  >=  0, shipments of product family p from facility f to satisfy demand in period t; back[p,t]  >=  0, end-of-period backlog for product family p; addcap[r,f,t]  >=  0, additional capacity hours on resource r at facility f in period t provided by investment; and capex[r,f,t]  in  {0,1}, the binary decision to invest in added capacity on resource r at facility f in period t.\n",

      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints for all relevant indices. Resource capacity with reliability and capex: on each resource r at facility f and period t, the total resource-hours implied by production (routing hours per unit multiplied by x) cannot exceed the usable hours equal to the supplier reliability derating factor times the sum of base capacity and any added capacity from investment. Labor feasibility: for each labor type l, facility f, and period t, the total labor-hours required by production (labor content per unit multiplied by x) must be no greater than productive regular hours per worker times assigned headcount plus overtime hours. Overtime per worker rule: for each labor type, facility, and period, total overtime hours cannot exceed the maximum overtime per worker times the assigned headcount, consistent with union rules. Headcount ceiling: assigned workers of each labor type at each facility and period cannot exceed the headcount limit. Inventory flow: for each product family and facility, end-of-period inventory equals prior inventory plus production minus shipments, with initial inventory set to the given stock at t = 0 and this balance enforced for t  >=  1. Demand reconciliation with backlog: for each product family and period t  >=  1, total shipments across all facilities plus end-of-period backlog equals the demand in that period plus prior backlog, with initial backlog set to zero. Capex-to-capacity linking: added capacity hours on any resource, facility, and period are bounded above by the per-investment capacity addition multiplied by the corresponding binary investment decision. Capex budget: total capacity investment spend over all resources, facilities, and periods cannot exceed the available capital budget. Capacity ramp-up: increases in added capacity on any resource at any facility between consecutive periods are limited by the ramp-up cap for that period. Production ramp-up: increases in production of any product family at any facility between consecutive periods are limited by the production ramp bound. Training pipeline with lead time: for any target labor type l2, facility f, and period t beyond the applicable lead times, available headcount must be at least the baseline scheduled headcount plus the completions of cross-training started LeadTime periods earlier (summed over all source labor types) minus expected attrition. Training capacity bound: the number of workers enrolled in cross-training from labor type l1 to l2 at any facility and period cannot exceed the training capacity for that program and time. Finally, non-negativity and integrality conditions hold: production, inventory, shipments, overtime, added capacity, and backlog variables are all nonnegative; staffing and cross-training counts are nonnegative integers; and capacity investment decisions are binary.\n",

      "Title: Symmetry-Aware Schedule Coloring with Chessboard Attack Conflicts\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: Given positive integers R and S, consider an R-by-S grid of unit tasks T = {t(r,s) : r = 1, ... ,R; s = 1, ... ,S}. Let C = {1, ... ,K_max} be candidate time-slot indices (“colors”), where K_max is an upper bound on the number of slots that may be used. A configurable set of chess-like attack rules AttackRules  subset of  {rook, bishop, queen, knight} induces an undirected conflict graph G = (T, E) on the grid in the usual way: if two tasks attack each other under the chosen rules, they are adjacent in E and cannot share a color. Let M be a set of machines; each task t has a resource demand d_t, is eligible only on machines A_t  subset of  M, and must be processed by exactly one machine. Each machine m has a per-slot capacity Cap_m. There is a set of precedence arcs P  subset of  T  times  T; for each (u, v) in P, the color of v must be at least the color of u plus a given nonnegative lag lag_u. The decision variables are: x_t  in  C, the color (time slot) assigned to task t; b_{t,c}  in  {0,1}, an indicator equal to 1 if and only if x_t = c; y_c  in  {0,1}, indicating whether color c is used by at least one task; and a_{t,m}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether task t is assigned to machine m.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective is to minimize the number of time slots used, i.e., minimize the sum over c in C of y_c. The constraints are as follows. Color-use linking: each task is assigned exactly one color (for every t, the indicators satisfy ∑_{c in C} b_{t,c} = 1), and b_{t,c} = 1 if and only if x_t = c. Activation of colors: if any task uses color c then that color is declared used (for every c and every t, y_c  >=  b_{t,c}). Conflict (graph coloring): adjacent tasks in the attack graph receive different colors (for every edge (u, v) in E, x_u  !=  x_v). Clique strengthening via global constraints: within each row r, all colors {x_{(r,1)},  ... , x_{(r,S)}} are pairwise different; within each column s, all colors {x_{(1,s)},  ... , x_{(R,s)}} are pairwise different; and, for every main diagonal and anti-diagonal that is induced by the chosen AttackRules, all colors along that diagonal are pairwise different. Machine assignment and eligibility: each task is assigned to exactly one machine and only to an eligible one (for every t, ∑_{m in M} a_{t,m} = 1 and a_{t,m} = 0 whenever m  not in  A_t). Per-slot capacity: in every color c and for every machine m, the total demand of tasks simultaneously assigned to color c and to machine m does not exceed Cap_m. Precedence with lags: for every (u, v) in P, the assigned colors satisfy x_u + lag_u  <=  x_v. Symmetry breaking: to reduce equivalent colorings, for each r = 1, ... ,R−1 the row color vector (x_{(r,1)},  ... , x_{(r,S)}) is lexicographically no greater than (x_{(r+1,1)},  ... , x_{(r+1,S)}).\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a daily vehicle routing and scheduling problem for a regional grocery e‑commerce network with multiple depots and a heterogeneous fleet, where each vehicle has dual compartments (ambient and refrigerated) and travel times depend on time of day. Each customer order has a delivery time window, service time with known mean and standard deviation, and municipal loading zone access windows. The planner may optionally outsource an order to a surge courier at a high cost. The model seeks robust schedules that meet target on‑time reliability levels by adding precomputed service buffers derived from chance constraints. Decision variables include: binary x_{i,j,v} indicating whether vehicle v traverses arc from node i to node j; binary y_{i,v} indicating whether customer i is assigned to vehicle v; binary m_{v} indicating whether vehicle v is used; binary z_{i} indicating whether customer i is outsourced to a surge courier; continuous s_{i,v} for the planned service start time at customer i by vehicle v; continuous a_{v} and r_{v} for vehicle v’s depot departure and return times; continuous h_{v} for overtime hours; continuous l_{i} for lateness beyond the end of the time window at customer i; binary u_{i,w} indicating which municipal loading window w is used at customer i’s zone; nonnegative qDry_{v} and qCold_{v} for total ambient and refrigerated payload on vehicle v; optional continuous t_{i,j,v} for the traversal start time on arc (i,j) by v (used for time‑dependent travel time linearization); binary wBreak_{v} indicating whether a mandatory driver break is scheduled; and continuous bStart_{v} and bDur_{v} for break start time and duration. Parameters include customer time windows, service time mean and standard deviation, risk tolerances, precomputed robust buffers, time‑of‑day travel time functions, compartment demands and capacities, regular shift lengths, municipal loading windows, cost coefficients, and a sufficiently large Big‑M.\n",

The following constraints must hold: for each customer, exclusivity of assignment versus outsourcing requires that the total number of in‑house departures from that customer across all vehicles plus the surge courier indicator equals one; for each customer–vehicle pair, visit consistency requires that the number of outgoing arcs from the customer assigned to that vehicle equals the assignment indicator, and the number of incoming arcs to the customer on that vehicle also equals the assignment indicator; for each vehicle, the number of arcs leaving its home depot equals the vehicle‑used indicator and the number of arcs entering the depot equals the same indicator; time propagation along any used arc enforces that the service start at the successor node is no earlier than the predecessor’s service start plus its mean service time and robust buffer plus the time‑of‑day travel time, relaxed by Big‑M when the arc is not used; customer time windows are enforced by requiring service to start no earlier than the window opening and no later than the window close plus allowed lateness, both relaxed by Big‑M when the customer is not assigned to a given vehicle; robust service buffers are treated as fixed parameters computed from the service‑time standard deviation and the inverse normal at the specified risk level; for each vehicle, the duty length is bounded by the regular shift plus overtime, with overtime nonnegative; depot linkage requires the service time at the first served customer to be no earlier than the depot departure plus travel time along the used first arc, and the depot return time to be no earlier than the last customer’s service start plus its mean service time and buffer plus travel time back to the depot; dual‑compartment capacity limits ensure that the total ambient and refrigerated demand assigned to each vehicle does not exceed its ambient and cold capacity, respectively; municipal loading compliance requires that for each customer exactly one applicable loading window be selected whenever the customer is served in‑house, and the customer’s service start time must lie within the selected window, relaxed by Big‑M otherwise; the driver break rule requires that if no break is scheduled, the duty length may not exceed the break threshold, and if a break is scheduled its duration is at least the minimum and service immediately after the break cannot start before the break end, enforced along arcs that cross the break via Big‑M; incompatibility between in‑house assignment and outsourcing requires that for any vehicle and customer, assignment plus outsourcing cannot exceed one; subtour elimination uses MTZ ordering variables with bounds, enforcing that for any distinct pair of customers on a vehicle the MTZ inequality holds to preclude cycles; if orders may not be split, each customer is assigned to at most one vehicle, consistent with the assignment constraint; and, when time‑dependent travel times are modeled piecewise, the traversal start time on each used arc equals the service start at the tail node and the travel‑time function is linearized via SOS2 or segment binaries, whereas a fixed travel‑time matrix may be used otherwise.

Let D be the set of coin denominations with monetary values v_d, M the set of meters partitioned into districts K with M_k  subset of  M, T the set of transaction times, and V the set of replenishment vehicles. Decision variables are: x_{d,m,t}  in  nonnegative integers, the number of coins of denomination d dispensed by meter m at time t; h_{d,m,t}  in  nonnegative integers, the hopper inventory of denomination d at meter m after transactions at time t; Htot_{m,t}  in  nonnegative reals, the total inventory across denominations at meter m and time t; z_{d,m,t}  in  nonnegative reals, the slack capturing deviation from the target proportion r_{d,m} of denomination d at meter m; q_{d,v,m,t}  in  nonnegative integers, the number of coins of denomination d delivered by vehicle v to meter m at time t; and y_{v,m,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether vehicle v visits meter m at time t.

To respect latency, the total number of coins dispensed at any transaction does not exceed C_max. Dispensing is limited by availability: for every denomination, meter, and time, x_{d,m,t} does not exceed the on-hand inventory h_{d,m,t}. Hopper inventories evolve over time so that, for each denomination, meter, and each time except the last, the next-period inventory equals current inventory minus dispensed coins plus the sum of delivered coins across vehicles; initial inventories at the first period equal the given h_init_{d,m}. For all denominations, meters, and times, inventories are bounded above by hopper capacities Hcap_{d,m} and below by safety-stock thresholds L_{d,m,t}. For each meter and time, the total inventory Htot_{m,t} equals the sum of denomination-specific inventories. Deviation from the target denomination mix is captured by nonnegative slacks: for every denomination, meter, and time, z_{d,m,t} bounds above both the positive and negative deviations of h_{d,m,t} from r_{d,m} times Htot_{m,t}; in addition, the sum of these slacks across denominations at a meter and time does not exceed the allowable total imbalance Δ_m. Vehicle operations are constrained so that each vehicle’s total delivered coins across all meters, times, and denominations does not exceed its capacity Q_v, and any delivery to a meter-time is permitted only if a visit occurs, enforced by bounding each q_{d,v,m,t} by y_{v,m,t} times the destination hopper capacity Hcap_{d,m}. Visit frequencies are limited: each meter may be visited at most Smax_m times over the horizon, and each vehicle may make at most N_v_max stops.

Each operation (i,k) may be processed on one compatible machine from M_{i,k}  subset of  M, with machine-dependent processing time p_{i,k,m}. Switching from operation (i,k) to (j,l) on machine m incurs a sequence-dependent setup S[(i,k),(j,l),m].

      "Formal Problem Statement: We are given a set of customer orders O and a small set of fixed start-time waves W. Each wave w has duration Dur_w, start time Start_w, a set of supported temperature classes C_w  subset of  C, a limited number S_c of station slots for each class c  in  C, a per-class weight capacity CapWeight_{w,c}, and a total volume capacity CapVol_w. Each order o  in  O has a required temperature class class(o), processing time p_o, due time due_o, weight weight_o, and volume volume_o. Decisions are: x_{o,w}  in  {0,1} indicates whether order o is assigned to wave w; y_{o,w}  in  {0}  union  {1, ... ,S_{class(o)}} is the station-slot index of order o in wave w (0 means “not assigned to wave w”); T_o  >=  0 is the tardiness of order o; u_o  in  {0,1} indicates whether order o is left unassigned. If assigned to wave w, order o completes at time Start_w + p_o; if it completes after due_o, it incurs tardiness. The objective is to minimize total cost ∑_{o in O}  alpha _o T_o + ∑_{o in O}  beta _u u_o, where  alpha _o  >=  0 and  beta _u  >=  0 are given penalties.\n",

      "The assignment and capacity constraints are: each order can be processed in at most one wave, i.e., for all o, ∑_{w in W} x_{o,w}  <=  1; the unassigned indicator satisfies u_o = 1 − ∑_{w in W} x_{o,w} and u_o  in  {0,1}. Linking assignment and slots, for all o,w, x_{o,w} = 0 if and only if y_{o,w} = 0, and if x_{o,w} = 1 then y_{o,w}  in  {1, ... ,S_{class(o)}}. Per-wave station exclusivity is enforced within each wave and class: for every wave w and class c, the nonzero slot indices {y_{o,w} : o with class(o)=c and y_{o,w} != 0} must be pairwise distinct (no two orders of the same class occupy the same station slot in w). Resource limits are respected by wave and class: for all w and c, ∑_{o: class(o)=c} weight_o  *  x_{o,w}  <=  CapWeight_{w,c}; and by wave volume: for all w, ∑_{o in O} volume_o  *  x_{o,w}  <=  CapVol_w. Feasibility in time requires that an order fits within any wave it is assigned to: for all o,w, if x_{o,w} = 1 then p_o  <=  Dur_w. Tardiness is defined reifically: for all o,w, if x_{o,w} = 1 then T_o  >=  (Start_w + p_o) − due_o; together with T_o  >=  0, this yields T_o = max{0, (Start_w + p_o) − due_o} for the unique assigned wave (and T_o  >=  0 if unassigned).

      "Formal Problem Statement: Problem statement. Consider an urban arterial corridor with a set of signalized intersections I, a discrete planning horizon of T time steps of size Δ seconds, and K cycles per intersection with fixed phase change order Order[i] in each cycle. At each intersection i, let P_i denote the set of vehicular phases, Conf_i the set of conflicting phase pairs, Cross_i the set of crosswalks with each crosswalk j served by a designated vehicular phase p(j), and movements m with storage capacities S[i,m] and expected platoon travel times TT[i,j,m] to downstream intersections. The directed pairs A identify adjacent intersections along the coordinated corridor, and C_corr is the designated corridor coordination cycle. Decision variables are: C[i] (integer seconds), the cycle length at intersection i; O[i] (integer seconds), the coordination offset at i relative to a corridor reference; s[i,p,k] (integer seconds), the green split allocated to phase p in cycle k at i; y[i,p,k] in {0,1}, an indicator that phase p is scheduled in cycle k at i; x[i,p,t] in {0,1}, a time-indexed indicator that phase p is active at i at time t; w[i,j,t] in {0,1}, a time-indexed indicator that the pedestrian WALK for crosswalk j at i is displayed at time t; q[i,m,t] (integer vehicles), the queue length for movement m at i at time t; n[i,j] (integer), the coordination integer connecting offsets of adjacent intersections (i,j) through a modulo relationship; and nonnegative absolute-deviation slacks delta C[i], delta O[i], and delta S[i,p,k] to quantify deviations from baselines C0[i], O0[i], and S0[i,p,k], respectively. The effective saturation service rate mu[i,m] at time t is given by the base rate mu_base[i,m] multiplied by a known construction factor alpha[i,m,t] in (0,1], and exogenous arrivals a[i,m,t] (vehicles) are given.\n",

All-red clearance intervals are enforced conditionally in time: whenever a phase p terminates at time t_end and the next phase q in the fixed order is to follow, no vehicular phase may be active for the ensuing AR[i,p to q] seconds (i.e., over the corresponding discrete time indices). Pedestrian service is guaranteed within its serving phase: for each crosswalk j at i and each cycle k, if y[i,p(j),k] = 1 then the allocated split satisfies s[i,p(j),k]  >=  W[i,j] + FDW[i,j].

Each door i carries a guarded implication whose antecedent and consequent refer to the occupancy of other doors: the antecedent selects a subset via A  in  {0,1}^{N times N} with A_{ij} = 1 if x_j appears in the antecedent for door i, and the consequent selects a subset via B  in  {0,1}^{N times N} with B_{ij} = 1 if x_j appears in the consequent “none-of” clause for door i. Let U_i = ∑_{j} A_{ij} and V_i = ∑_{j} B_{ij}. The decision variables are binary: x_i  in  {0,1} for i = 1..N indicates the Lady is behind door i; s_i  in  {0,1} indicates whether door i’s inscription is truthful; T_i  in  {0,1} is the truth value of the guarded implication on door i; G_i  in  {0,1} and H_i  in  {0,1} are the truth values of the antecedent and consequent clauses for door i, respectively; and d_i  in  {0,1} indicates the chosen door to open. Given strictly positive, pairwise distinct weights w_i and a designated watchpoint door r_star  in  {1..N}, maximize Z = ∑_{i=1}^N w_i x_i to break ties among multiple satisfying assignments while ensuring safety.\n",

Open exactly the safe door: ∑_{i=1}^N d_i = 1 and d_i = x_i for all i. Antecedent clause evaluation: for each i, G_i equals 1 if and only if at least one selected x_j with A_{ij} = 1 is 1, encoded by ∑_{j=1}^N A_{ij} x_j  >=  G_i and ∑_{j=1}^N A_{ij} x_j  <=  U_i G_i.

      "The schedule must satisfy the following constraints. Machine assignment: each operation is assigned to exactly one machine from its eligibility set. Operation duration with alternative machines: the completion time equals the start time plus the processing time on the chosen machine. Routing precedence: for each job, every operation starts no earlier than the completion of its immediate predecessor. Machine disjunctive non‑overlap with sequence‑dependent setup: for any two distinct operations that could both run on a given machine, they cannot overlap; one must precede the other, and the appropriate sequence‑dependent setup time is inserted, enforced via big‑M disjunctive constraints, with y[a,b,m] indicating which precedes which and y linked so it can be 1 only if both operations are assigned to that machine. Maintenance windows on machines: for any operation assigned to a machine with a maintenance interval, it must be scheduled either entirely before or entirely after that window, enforced by big‑M constraints governed by q[j,o,m,mu] and linked to the machine assignment. Qualified operator assignment: each operation is assigned to exactly one qualified operator‑day among the operators qualified for that operation. Operator non‑overlap per day: operations assigned to the same operator on the same day/shift cannot overlap, enforced with big‑M disjunctions, with u[a,b,p,d] indicating precedence and linked to the operator‑day assignments. Operator capacity with overtime: for each operator and day/shift, the total assigned processing time cannot exceed regular capacity plus the chosen overtime h[p,d]. Tooling non‑overlap when a tool has a single available unit: any two operations requiring the same unique tool cannot overlap, enforced via big‑M precedence with r[a,b,t]. Heat‑treat/paint batch assignment: each such operation is assigned to exactly one furnace/booth and one batch index. Batch capacity: for each furnace/booth batch, the sum of assigned operation loads (mass or rack‑space) does not exceed the equipment’s capacity. Batch duration and linkage: the batch duration is at least as long as the cycle time required by each assigned operation (so it covers the recipe maximum), batch completion equals batch start plus its duration, and the start and completion of any operation assigned to a batch are aligned with the batch’s start and completion via big‑M linkages. Certification time windows: paint and inspection operations requiring certification or calibrated gage windows must start no earlier than the window’s start and finish no later than its end.

Participation definition: a pair participates if and only if it lies in a selected cycle or chain, pi = ∑k in K: i in k zk + ∑m in M: i in m cm for all i  in  V; together with pi  <=  1 this enforces that selected cycles and chains are vertex-disjoint.

      "Title: Two-Door Signage Synthesis and Difficulty Optimization\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: Consider a two-door puzzle design with doors i  in  {1,2}. For each door, x[i]  in  {0,1] indicates whether the door contains its designated object (1) or not (0), and t[i]  in  {0,1} indicates whether the door’s inscription is true under the chosen configuration. For each door i, exactly one signage template is selected from {SELF, XOR, MUTUAL} via binary selectors z[i,SELF], z[i,XOR], z[i,MUTUAL] with z[i,SELF] + z[i,XOR] + z[i,MUTUAL] = 1. Auxiliary binary variables b and e encode b = x[1] ∧ x[2] and e = x[1] ⊕ x[2] through linear constraints specified below. The scalar difficulty score D  in  ℝ is to be maximized. Parameters w_SELF, w_XOR, w_MUTUAL are nonnegative weights capturing the perceived reasoning complexity of each template, and  gamma  > 0 is a bonus weight for inducing XOR structure. All x[i], t[i], z[i,k], b, e are binary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The logical semantics and playability are enforced by the following constraints. For SELF templates, the inscription equals the door’s content: when z[i,SELF] = 1, t[i] = x[i], expressed via t[i] − x[i]  <=  1 − z[i,SELF] and x[i] − t[i]  <=  1 − z[i,SELF] for i = 1,2. The conjunction and XOR structure are encoded as b  >=  x[1] + x[2] − 1, b  <=  x[1], b  <=  x[2], and e = x[1] + x[2] − 2b. For XOR templates, the inscription states “exactly one door contains its object”: when z[i,XOR] = 1, t[i] = e, enforced by t[i] − e  <=  1 − z[i,XOR] and e − t[i]  <=  1 − z[i,XOR] for i = 1,2. For MUTUAL templates, the inscription matches the other door’s inscription truth: when z[1,MUTUAL] = 1, t[1] = t[2], enforced by t[1] − t[2]  <=  1 − z[1,MUTUAL] and t[2] − t[1]  <=  1 − z[1,MUTUAL]; when z[2,MUTUAL] = 1, t[2] = t[1], enforced by t[2] − t[1]  <=  1 − z[2,MUTUAL] and t[1] − t[2]  <=  1 − z[2,MUTUAL]. The playability criterion requires exactly one inscription to be true: t[1] + t[2] = 1. To avoid degenerate mutual-dependence loops, at most one door may choose the MUTUAL template: z[1,MUTUAL] + z[2,MUTUAL]  <=  1. The ground-truth object placement must also satisfy x[1]  >=  x[2]. The difficulty score is defined by D = w_SELF * (z[1,SELF] + z[2,SELF]) + w_XOR * (z[1,XOR] + z[2,XOR]) + w_MUTUAL * (z[1,MUTUAL] + z[2,MUTUAL]) +  gamma  * e. The objective is to maximize D subject to all the constraints above.\n",
      "Objective: Maximize a linear difficulty score D that rewards harder signage choices and XOR structure while preserving logical consistency and playability.\n",
      "Expected Output: An optimal configuration including: which signage template is selected for each door (z variables), the ground-truth object placement (x[1], x[2]), the resulting inscription truth flags (t[1], t[2]), and the maximum difficulty score D. The solution is guaranteed to satisfy the logical semantics, avoid degeneracy, and meet playability constraints.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: We seek a month-long mixed-integer linear plan assigning eligible staff drivers to transport colleagues between the main campus and satellite clinics at specified time windows across all planning days. Let D be the set of days, T the set of time windows per day, C the set of clinic routes, and S the set of eligible staff. Decision variables are: z_{d,t,c,s}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether staff s drives the route for clinic c at time window t on day d; g_s  in  nonnegative integers, the total number of drives assigned to staff s over the month;  delta _s^+  >=  0 and  delta _s^-  >=  0, the positive and negative deviations of staff s’s monthly drive count from their owed share owed_s; and short_{d,t,c}  >=  0, the unmet rider demand (seat shortfall) for clinic c at time window t on day d. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of equity deviations, unmet-demand penalties, and operating costs: the sum over staff of w_equity_s * ( delta _s^+ +  delta _s^-), plus the sum over trips of w_short * short_{d,t,c}, plus the sum over assignments of cost_{d,t,c,s} * z_{d,t,c,s}.\n",

Demand coverage with slack: for each day, time window, and clinic, the total seat capacity supplied (the sum over staff of cap_s * z_{d,t,c,s}) plus short_{d,t,c} must be at least the rider demand need_{d,t,c}. Driver time exclusivity and availability: for each day, time window, and staff, the number of routes assigned to that staff at that moment (the sum over clinics of z_{d,t,c,s}) must be less than or equal to availability_{d,t,s} (so a staff can drive at most one route, and only if available). Route-specific licensing: for every assignment, z_{d,t,c,s} must be zero unless licenseRoute_{s,c} = 1, ensuring staff are only assigned to routes they are authorized to drive. Early-rounds eligibility: for trips flagged as early rounds (early_window_{d,t,c} = 1), z_{d,t,c,s} must be zero unless early_ok_s = 1, ensuring only eligible staff are assigned to early windows. Fleet limit per time window: for each day and time window, the total number of vehicles dispatched (the sum over clinics and staff of z_{d,t,c,s}) cannot exceed fleet_limit_{d,t}. Monthly drive count definition: for each staff s, g_s equals the total number of drives assigned, i.e., the sum over all days, times, and clinics of z_{d,t,c,s}. Equity deviation decomposition: for each staff s, the deviation from the owed share satisfies g_s − owed_s =  delta _s^+ −  delta _s^−, with  delta _s^+  >=  0 and  delta _s^-  >=  0; additionally, short_{d,t,c}  >=  0.

      "Formal Problem Statement: Given a set A of allies, each ally i requires two single-machine operations performed in order on the same resource (the player): a disarm operation with processing time p_i^D followed by a recovery operation with processing time p_i^R. Between the end of disarm and the start of recovery for ally i, the start-to-start lag must lie between a minimum L_i and a maximum U_i. The machine can process at most one operation at a time. Switching directly from any operation u to any distinct operation v incurs a sequence-dependent setup time S_{type(u), type(v)} plus a global cooldown g. The mission has a hard deadline T by which a recovery must finish to count. Each ally i has a nonnegative value v_i. Define the operation set O = {(i, D), (i, R) : i in A}. Decision variables are: s_{i,D}  >=  0 and s_{i,R}  >=  0, the start times of disarm and recovery for ally i; y_{i,D} and y_{i,R} in {0,1}, indicating whether the disarm and recovery operations of ally i are scheduled; z_i in {0,1}, indicating whether ally i is fully readied (both stages complete by T); for any two distinct operations u, v in O, x_{u,v} in {0,1}, indicating that u directly precedes v; and for any unordered distinct pair {u, v} in O,  lambda _{u,v} in {0,1}, indicating that both u and v are scheduled (enabling exactly-one precedence between them). Let p_u denote the processing time of operation u, and s_u its start time. The objective is to maximize total readiness value, that is, maximize the sum over i in A of v_i  *  z_i.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constraints are as follows, using a sufficiently large constant M to deactivate conditions when z_i = 0: for every ally i, if i is selected (z_i = 1) then the recovery start must satisfy the time-lag bounds relative to the disarm completion, namely s_{i,R}  >=  s_{i,D} + p_i^D + L_i and s_{i,R}  <=  s_{i,D} + p_i^D + U_i; otherwise these bounds are relaxed via Big-M (s_{i,R}  >=  s_{i,D} + p_i^D + L_i − M(1 − z_i) and s_{i,R}  <=  s_{i,D} + p_i^D + U_i + M(1 − z_i)). If i is selected, its recovery must also finish by the deadline: s_{i,R} + p_i^R  <=  T + M(1 − z_i). Selection consistency requires y_{i,D} = z_i and y_{i,R} = z_i for all i, so both operations are scheduled if and only if the ally is counted. For any two distinct operations u and v in O, if x_{u,v} = 1 (u directly precedes v), then v cannot start until u has completed, all required setup has been performed, and the global cooldown has elapsed: s_v  >=  s_u + p_u + S_{type(u), type(v)} + g − M(1 − x_{u,v}). Precedence variables can only activate when the corresponding operation is scheduled: for each unordered pair {u, v}, x_{u,v}  <=  y_u and x_{v,u}  <=  y_v. Exactly one precedence direction must hold between any scheduled pair: for each unordered pair {u, v}, x_{u,v} + x_{v,u} =  lambda _{u,v}. The pair-activation indicator enforces that precedence is considered if and only if both operations are scheduled: for each unordered pair {u, v},  lambda _{u,v}  <=  y_u,  lambda _{u,v}  <=  y_v, and  lambda _{u,v}  >=  y_u + y_v − 1.

A set K of demand cells represents hotspots; a demand cell k in K is considered covered if there is at least one unit within Manhattan distance r of k. Each demand cell k has an importance weight d_k, each location (i,j) has an installation cost cost_{i,j}, and alpha >= 0 is a trade-off coefficient.

Coverage is linked by requiring, for each demand cell k, that y_k is at most the number of placed units within Manhattan distance r of k (i.e., y_k <= ∑_{(i,j) in N_r(k)} x_{i,j}, where N_r(k) denotes the cells within distance r of k).

Tiles are drawn from the duplicate double-six domino set: for every unordered pip pair {p,q} with 0  <=  p  <=  q  <=  6 there are exactly two copies available, for a total of 28 types and 56 tiles. Placements Z[i,j,o,p,q] are binary variables indicating that an oriented domino with ordered pips (p,q) starts at cell (i,j), runs in orientation o  in  {horizontal, vertical}, and covers its orthogonal neighbor; Y[p,q] is an integer in {0,1,2} counting how many copies of unordered type {p,q} have been placed (aggregating both orientations and orders). For each orthogonal edge e of the grid, C[e] is a nonnegative integer equal to the number of candidate tile types remaining after arc consistency when considering the labels at the two endpoints of e and the multiplicity still available; S[e] is a binary indicator of a forced move on e (S[e] = 1 if and only if C[e] = 1). The totals H = sum of S[e] over all edges, R = sum over all edges of max(C[e]−1,0), and B_used = the minimal number of backtracking steps required to complete the proof of uniqueness under the specified propagation-and-branching schedule are decision variables induced by the design.

For each household h, category c, and week w, category quantity aggregates item counts: the sum of x[h,i,w] over items i in I_c equals y_qty[h,c,w]. For each household h, partner p, and week w, spend is defined by item counts and unit prices: s[h,p,w] equals the sum over items i of price[i,p,w] times x[h,i,w]. For each household-week (h,w), the difference between total partner spends and the observed total is captured by two nonnegative deviations: the sum over partners p of s[h,p,w] minus s_obs[h,w] equals e_pos[h,w] minus e_neg[h,w], with e_pos[h,w] and e_neg[h,w] each bounded above by epsilon[h,w].

Spend parity is enforced across paired partners: for all p and q, the aggregate spend difference across all households and weeks is bounded by Delta when w[p,q] = 1, i.e., the sum over h and w of s[h,p,w] minus the sum over h and w of s[h,q,w] is at most Delta, and its negative is at most Delta; when w[p,q] = 0, these bounds are relaxed by M via the standard big-M form. Merchandising tests are encoded as indicator equivalences: for every (i,j) in TestPairs, household h, and week w, z[h,i,j,w] = 1 implies x[h,i,w] − x[h,j,w]  >=  theta[i,j], and z[h,i,j,w] = 0 implies x[h,i,w] − x[h,j,w]  <=  theta[i,j] − 1, implemented with big-M bounds x[h,i,w] − x[h,j,w]  >=  theta[i,j] − M(1 − z[h,i,j,w]) and x[h,i,w] − x[h,j,w]  <=  (theta[i,j] − 1) + M z[h,i,j,w]. Administered category prices are fixed: for every c in C_admin and week w, y_price[c,w] = P_cat[c,w]. Category price-fit is reconciled to item-level spend with bounded deviations: for every household h, category c, and week w, the sum over partners p and items i in I_c of price[i,p,w] times x[h,i,w] minus y_price[c,w] times y_qty[h,c,w] equals r_pos[h,c,w] minus r_neg[h,c,w], with r_pos[h,c,w] and r_neg[h,c,w] each bounded above by gamma[c].

The decision variables are: X[i,j]  in  {1, ... ,n} for all cells (i,j), denoting the final Latin grid values; Y_s[i,j]  in  {0,1} indicating whether cell (i,j) lies on stream s; E_s[(i,j),(p,q)]  in  {0,1} for ((i,j),(p,q))  in  G, indicating whether the edge between adjacent cells is used by stream s; C[i,j]  in  {0,1} indicating whether the value of cell (i,j) is revealed as a clue;  delta _s  >=  0, the absolute deviation of stream s’s realized length from L_s; U  in  ℕ, the number of undecided cells defined by U = ∑_{i,j} (1 − C[i,j]); rClues[i]  in  ℕ, the number of clues in row i; cClues[j]  in  ℕ, the number of clues in column j; and  rho _i  >=  0 and κ_j  >=  0, the absolute deviations of row i and column j clue counts from rTarget and cTarget, respectively.\n",

Latin-square feasibility: in every row i the values X[i,1], ... ,X[i,n] are pairwise distinct, and in every column j the values X[1,j], ... ,X[n,j] are pairwise distinct. Stream formation and coverage: for each stream s, its terminals t  in  T_s must belong to the stream (Y_s[t] = 1). Let deg_s(i,j) be the sum over orthogonal neighbors (p,q) of E_s[(i,j),(p,q)]; then if Y_s[i,j] = 1 and (i,j) is a terminal in T_s, require deg_s(i,j) = 1; if Y_s[i,j] = 1 and (i,j) is not a terminal, require deg_s(i,j) = 2; and if Y_s[i,j] = 0, require deg_s(i,j) = 0. Edge consistency: for each adjacent pair ((i,j),(p,q))  in  G and stream s, an edge may be used only if both endpoints lie on the stream, i.e., E_s[(i,j),(p,q)]  <=  Y_s[i,j] and E_s[(i,j),(p,q)]  <=  Y_s[p,q]. Disjointness: no cell belongs to more than one stream, i.e., ∑_{s=1}^k Y_s[i,j]  <=  1 for all (i,j). Stream value uniqueness: for each stream s, the values X[i,j] over all cells with Y_s[i,j] = 1 are pairwise distinct. Clue consistency: if Given[i,j]  !=  0, then C[i,j] = 1 and X[i,j] = Given[i,j]. Clue budget: ∑_{i,j} C[i,j]  <=  C_max. Mobile performance proxy: U = ∑_{i,j} (1 − C[i,j]) and U  <=  U_max. Path-length deviation: for each stream s, with observed length L_s^obs = ∑_{i,j} Y_s[i,j], enforce  delta _s  >=  L_s^obs − L_s and  delta _s  >=  L_s − L_s^obs.

Symmetry pruning: fix X[1,1] = 1 and impose a strict increase along the first row, X[1,j] < X[1,j+1] for j = 1, ... ,n−1.

(iii) Degree constraints (no dead ends except endpoints): for every cell, the number of used undirected incident edges equals 2y_{i,j} − s_{i,j} − t_{i,j}, so interior path cells have degree 2, the start has degree 1 via s_{i,j}=1, and the end has degree 1 via t_{i,j}=1.

Time-window feasibility and sequencing are enforced as follows: if shipment i is assigned to position t in wave k, then the start time s_{k,t} lies within [e_i, l_i], encoded by s_{k,t}  >=  e_i − M(1 − x_{i,k,t}) and s_{k,t}  <=  l_i + M(1 − x_{i,k,t}); and successive positions in each wave respect processing durations, s_{k,t+1}  >=  s_{k,t} + sum over i of p_i x_{i,k,t} for t = 1, ... ,4. Wave priorities are defined by value_k = sum over i of v_i times the sum of x_{i,k,t} over t.

Each car k has capacity Cap_k, door dwell time tau_d applies to boarding and alighting, and the minimum travel time between floors i and j is d_min(i,j).

Supplier allocations provide A_i kg of each ingredient i (with optional import quota caps Q_i_imp for i in a subset I_imp), and the planner targets an ingredient reserve R_i_target with penalty  gamma _i per kg of shortfall below the target. Each line l has H_l available hours. SKU k has weekly batch bounds Bmin_k and Bmax_k, a demand cap D_k, and, if promoted (k  in  P), a committed minimum L_k.

Certain slots t are blocked by fixed cutscenes, indicated by c_t = 1. Precedence arcs P specify that action j may not begin until action i has finished and recovered. The decision variables are: for each action i and slot t, a binary start indicator x_{i,t} (1 if i starts at t, otherwise 0); for each action i, a binary scheduling indicator a_i (1 if i is executed, otherwise 0; optional actions may be omitted); for each action i, an integer start time S_i derived from x_{i,t}; and for each slot t  >=  T, a binary overtime indicator b_t (1 if any execution or recovery occupies t, otherwise 0).

Single-thread occupancy with recovery and cutscene exclusion: at every slot t, counting all actions whose execution or recovery covers t, the total occupancy cannot exceed one; if c_t = 1, no player occupancy is permitted at t. Precedence with recovery: for every (i, j)  in  P, action j may start only after action i finishes and its recovery window completes. Earliest/latest narrative windows: if action i is scheduled, its start must lie within [E_i, L_i]; if omitted, these bounds are relaxed via big-M. Forbidden late starts: starting after L_i is prohibited by enforcing x_{i,t} = 0 for all t > L_i. Mandatory completion before sunset: every mandatory action must finish no later than slot T.

(vii) Line-of-sight along rows: for row-aligned pairs (i1 = i2), e[i1,j1,a,i2,j2,t] can be 1 only if every cell strictly between j1 and j2 in that row is free of obstacles (no o[i1,k] = 1 for k between j1 and j2).

(ix) Per-unit reach satisfaction: every unit a  in  U_B  union  U_R has at least one valid engagement at its declared reach, i.e., ∑_{t in Opp(a)}∑_{i1,j1,i2,j2} e[i1,j1,a,i2,j2,t]  >=  1. (x) Directional balance: E_row equals the sum of e over all row-based engagements (i1 = i2), E_col equals the sum of e over all column-based engagements (j1 = j2), and E_row = E_col. (xi) Obstacle budget: ∑_{i=1..N}∑_{j=1..N} o[i,j]  <=  O_max. (xii) Symmetry-consistent engagement mirroring: each engagement variable equals its image under both diagonal reflections, i.e., for all (i1,j1,i2,j2,a,t), e[i1,j1,a,i2,j2,t] = e[j1,i1,a,j2,i2,t] and e[i1,j1,a,i2,j2,t] = e[N+1−j1, N+1−i1, a, N+1−j2, N+1−i2, t].\n",

      "Title: Triangular Edge-Matching Puzzle Design Optimization with Rotation and Pigment Robustness\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: We seek to design a manufacturable triangular edge‑matching puzzle comprising N triangular pieces placed on a fixed triangular board with N slots arranged in a triangular grid. Each slot has three edges, and each piece carries three abstract color labels (one per edge). A piece may be placed into any slot with one of three rotations corresponding to 0°, 120°, and 240°. Decision variables are: x[p,s,r]  in  {0,1}, indicating whether piece p  in  P is placed in slot s  in  S with rotation r  in  R = {0,1,2}; u[s,e,c]  in  {0,1}, a one‑hot indicator of the color label c  in  C on edge e  in  {0,1,2} of slot s induced by the chosen piece and rotation; y[c,m]  in  {0,1}, indicating whether abstract color label c is printed using pigment m  in  M; and z[p,s]  in  {0,1}, aggregating whether piece p is placed in slot s regardless of rotation, with z[p,s] = ∑r x[p,s,r]. Parameters include the edge‑color mapping alpha[p,e,r,c], which is 1 if, under rotation r, piece p places color c on slot‑edge e (equivalently, col[p,(e − r) mod 3] = c), adjacency pairs A of touching slot‑edges, border edges B with required border color labels bcol[s,e], a candidate pigment set M with unit costs cost[m], measured pigment distances D[m1,m2], a registration tolerance T_reg, a minimum effective distinguishability threshold  tau _min, forbidden pigment pairs F_ab for each ordered color‑label pair (a,b) in Q where the degraded effective distance falls below  tau _min, pattern‑equivalent piece pairs H, and designated reference indices p_ref and corner slot s_ref for symmetry breaking.\n",

      "Each piece must be used exactly once: for every p, the sum of x[p,s,r] over all slots s and rotations r equals 1. Each slot must be filled by exactly one piece in one rotation: for every s, the sum of x[p,s,r] over all pieces p and rotations r equals 1. The edge color on each slot‑edge is propagated from the chosen piece and its rotation: for every slot s, edge e, and color label c, u[s,e,c] equals the sum over p and r of alpha[p,e,r,c] * x[p,s,r], and for each slot‑edge exactly one color is active, i.e., the u[s,e,c] vector is one‑hot with ∑c u[s,e,c] = 1. Internal seam matching is enforced: for every adjacent edge pair ((s,e),(t,f)) in A and for every color label c, the indicators agree, u[s,e,c] = u[t,f,c], ensuring the two touching edges carry the same color. Border colors are prescribed: for every border edge (s,e) in B, the outward‑facing edge color equals the required label, u[s,e,bcol[s,e]] = 1. To break global dihedral symmetry of the board, a designated reference piece is fixed in a designated corner slot with a reference rotation: x[p_ref, s_ref, 0] = 1. The aggregation variable is defined as z[p,s] = ∑r x[p,s,r] for all p and s. Exactly one pigment must be selected for each abstract color label: for every c, the sum of y[c,m] over all pigments m equals 1. Pigment distinguishability under registration tolerance is enforced by forbidding low‑contrast pairs: for every ordered color‑label pair (a,b) in Q and for every forbidden pigment pair (m1,m2) in F_ab, y[a,m1] + y[b,m2]  <=  1, thereby ensuring that any colors that can be adjacent or critically compared are printed with pigments whose effective distance under T_reg meets or exceeds  tau _min. Finally, to avoid swap degeneracy among pattern‑equivalent pieces, for every pair (p,q) in H, let s* be the lowest‑index slot; then the ordering constraint ∑r x[p,s*,r]  >=  ∑r x[q,s*,r] is enforced.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: We are given a triangular board with a finite set P of indexed positions arranged on a triangular lattice. A finite set I of triangular tiles (pieces) is available, each with three orientations r in R = {0,1,2}. Each tile’s three directed edges are indexed by A = {0,1,2}, and each edge carries a discrete color code c in C = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Designers provide an admissibility mask A[p,i,r]  in  {0,1} indicating which placements (p,i,r) are allowed without override. For each tile i, orientation r, and edge a, the one-hot color artifact Col[i,r,a,c]  in  {0,1} specifies whether that edge exhibits color c. The set E collects unordered adjacency relations between half-edges as pairs ((p,a),(q,b)), and B denotes the set of boundary half-edges (p,a) with required boundary colors Bcol[p,a]  in  C. Camera vision requires sufficient contrast: Inc is the set of incompatible color pairs (c,d) whose color distance ΔE(c,d) is below a threshold Vmin and thus cannot meet across an inner edge. Manufacturing QA provides per-color CIELAB targets LabSpec[c,k] and measured/forecasted LabPrint[c,k], k  in  {L,a,b}. The decision variables are: x[p,i,r]  in  {0,1} (1 if piece i is placed at position p in orientation r), g[p,a,c]  in  {0,1} (1 if half-edge (p,a) is assigned color c as implied by x and Col), s[p,a]  >=  0 (nonnegative boundary mismatch slack at half-edge (p,a)), h[p,i,r]  in  {0,1} (1 if inadmissible placement (p,i,r) is enabled via override), z  in  {0,1} (uniqueness-adversary activation; z=1 forces construction of a distinct second solution, z=0 disables it), x2[p,i,r]  in  {0,1} and g2[p,a,c]  in  {0,1} (second-solution assignment and half-edge color variables, active only when z=1), s2[p,a]  >=  0 (second-solution boundary slack), d[p,i,r]  in  {0,1} (difference indicators satisfying d[p,i,r]  >=  |x[p,i,r] − x2[p,i,r]|), t[c]  >=  0 (print color deviation proxy per color code), and auxiliary u_plus[c,k]  >=  0, u_minus[c,k]  >=  0 used to linearize the absolute CIELAB deviation.

Adjacent half-edges must match in color, i.e., for every adjacency ((p,a),(q,b))  in  E and every c  in  C, g[p,a,c] = g[q,b,c]. Boundary edges must carry the specified boundary colors, with deviations captured by slack: for all (p,a)  in  B, ∑i in I ∑r in R Col[i,r,a,Bcol[p,a]] * x[p,i,r] + s[p,a] = 1 and s[p,a]  >=  0. Camera-vision contrast rules forbid incompatible color pairs across inner edges: for all ((p,a),(q,b))  in  E and all (c,d)  in  Inc, g[p,a,c] + g[q,b,d]  <=  1. To certify uniqueness, a gated “second solution” submodel is embedded: if z=1, it must itself be a complete feasible assignment; if z=0, it is identically zero. Specifically, for all p  in  P, ∑i in I ∑r in R x2[p,i,r] = z, and for all i  in  I, ∑p in P ∑r in R x2[p,i,r] = z; for all p,a,c, g2[p,a,c] = ∑i in I ∑r in R Col[i,r,a,c] * x2[p,i,r] and ∑c in C g2[p,a,c] = z. When z=1, the second solution must satisfy the same adjacency and boundary conditions (enforced via indicator gating): for every ((p,a),(q,b))  in  E and c  in  C, the selected colors must match on both sides, and for every (p,a)  in  B, ∑i in I ∑r in R Col[i,r,a,Bcol[p,a]] * x2[p,i,r] + s2[p,a] = z with s2[p,a]  >=  0.

Finally, the print color deviation proxy per color uses a linear L1 epigraph: for every c  in  C and k  in  {L,a,b}, u_plus[c,k] − u_minus[c,k] = LabPrint[c,k] − LabSpec[c,k] with u_plus[c,k]  >=  0 and u_minus[c,k]  >=  0, and t[c]  >=  u_plus[c,L] + u_plus[c,a] + u_plus[c,b] + u_minus[c,L] + u_minus[c,a] + u_minus[c,b].\n",

Edit linkage with big-M: for each heap, r_i equals x_i minus y_i, r_i is nonnegative, and r_i is bounded above by U times d_i so that no tokens are removed unless the heap is flagged as edited (U is a sufficiently large constant). Per-heap cap: each y_i does not exceed M_i. Per-column cap: for each bit column b, the count of 1s across all heaps, summed over i as y_{i,b}, does not exceed C_b.

Decision variables are: y_{i,j,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether edge (i to j) is executed at hop t; w_{i,t}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether node i is occupied at step t (t = 1, ... ,T+1); q_t  >=  0, the notional executed at hop t in funding-currency equivalent; p_t  >=  0, the portfolio value in funding currency after hop t (with p_0  >=  0 given); p_edge_{i,j,t}  >=  0, the value contribution at hop t if edge (i to j) is chosen; s_t  >=  0, the slippage cost at hop t;  lambda _{k,t}  >=  0, the slippage segment flows over breakpoints b_{k,t} with SOS2 structure (k = 1, ... ,K_t); stale_t  >=  0, the stale-quote risk at hop t; and z, the objective value. The objective is to maximize z = p_T − p_0 −  gamma  * ∑_{t=1}^T stale_t, i.e., maximize final value in the funding currency net of the initial notional and a penalty for stale quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The route must satisfy: initialization and termination at the funding currency (node s occupied at steps 1 and T+1), exactly one outgoing edge from s chosen at the first hop, and exactly one incoming edge to s chosen at the last hop. At every step t, exactly one node is occupied, and at every hop t, exactly one edge is executed. Flow continuity is enforced so that, for each node i and hop t, the sum of outgoing edges chosen from i at hop t equals the occupancy of i at step t, and for each node j and step t  >=  2, the sum of incoming edges chosen to j at hop t−1 equals the occupancy of j at step t. Vertex uniqueness holds: no intermediate node i  !=  s may be occupied more than once across all steps. Regulatory and venue gating is respected by allowing an edge to be selected only if it is available/compliant at that hop (y_{i,j,t}  <=  A_{i,j,t}). Liquidity caps bind per hop: the executed size q_t must not exceed the liquidity cap of the chosen edge at that hop, with a large constant U relaxing the bound for edges not selected. A minimum tradable size is enforced so each executed hop trades at least q_min. Slippage is modeled piecewise-linearly with SOS2: for each hop t, q_t equals the sum of segment flows  lambda _{k,t}, s_t equals the sum of slope coefficients  alpha _{k,t} times  lambda _{k,t}, and the  lambda _{k,t} lie on two adjacent breakpoints b_{k,t}. Value propagation uses big-M activation: for each edge and hop, p_edge_{i,j,t} is bounded above by U * y_{i,j,t} and, when the edge is chosen, equals (r_{i,j,t} − f_{i,j,t}) * p_{t−1} − s_t, while big-M bounds deactivate it otherwise; the portfolio value aggregates these contributions so p_t equals the sum over all p_edge_{i,j,t} at hop t. Stale-quote penalties bind by setting stale_t equal to the risk score of the chosen edge at hop t and capping it by a per-hop maximum  tau _max. The optimal solution returns the ordered hop sequence, edge selections, node occupancies, trade sizes, slippage costs, portfolio value trajectory, final value, and objective value, while satisfying cycle integrity, uniqueness, continuity, gating, liquidity, slippage, value-propagation, and stale-quote constraints.\n",
      "Objective: Maximize z = p_T - p_0 - gamma * sum_{t=1}^{T} stale_t, where p_T is the final portfolio value in the funding currency after T hops, p_0 is the initial notional, and stale_t is a per-step stale-quote risk term computed from chosen edges.\n",
      "Expected Output: An optimal round-trip route that lists the ordered hop sequence (currencies/venues), the chosen edges y_{i,j,t}, node occupancies w_{i,t}, per-hop trade sizes q_t, slippage costs s_t, the portfolio value trajectory p_t, the final value p_T, and the objective value z, along with feasibility confirmation that cycle-integrity, uniqueness, and liquidity constraints are satisfied.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Markov-Driven Fertilizer Quality and Logistics Optimization. A fertilizer blending and distribution firm manages granular urea and NPK across facilities and weeks, with product quality evolving stochastically due to humidity and handling. For products p, facilities f, discrete quality states s, customers/regions c, weeks t, and environmental scenarios xi (with probabilities pi_{xi}), the firm decides: nonnegative inventory I_{p,f,s,t}^{xi} by state and period; shipments Ship_{p,f,c,s,t}^{xi} by facility, customer, and state; screening volumes W_{p,f,s,t}^{xi}; regranulation volumes R_{p,f,s,t}^{xi}; salvage/write-off volumes S_{p,f,s,t}^{xi}; procurement Proc_{p,f,t} (first-stage, scenario-independent, nonnegative); backlogs B_{p,c,t}^{xi} (nonnegative); and binary activation y_{f,screen,t}, y_{f,regran,t} for screening and regranulation lines (first-stage, scenario-independent). The objective is to minimize the expected total cost over scenarios, comprising procurement, screening, regranulation, salvage, holding, shipping, customer credits for selling from non-ideal states, backlog penalties, and line activation costs, with expectation taken using pi_{xi}.\n",

      "Constraints are as follows. Quality-state inventory balance: for each product, facility, quality state, week (except the last), and scenario, the inventory in state s at week t+1 equals the Markov transition of the on-hand inventory remaining after shipments, screening, regranulation, and salvage, plus the outputs of processing and procurement: specifically, sum over prior states s′ of M_{f,s′,s,t}^{xi} applied to I_{p,f,s′,t}^{xi} minus Ship, W, R, and S; plus screening yields sum_{s′} rho_{s′,s} W_{p,f,s′,t}^{xi}; plus regranulation yield eta times sum_{s′} R_{p,f,s′,t}^{xi} into the Good state only; plus procurement Proc_{p,f,t} added to the Good state only.

Regranulation capacity: for each facility and week in each scenario, the total regranulated volume across products and states does not exceed Cap_regran_{f,t} times the activation y_{f,regran,t}. Storage capacity: for each facility and week in each scenario, total inventory across products and states does not exceed StorageCap_{f,t}. Shipment feasibility by state: for each product, facility, state, week, and scenario, total shipments out of a state cannot exceed the inventory on hand in that state. Demand fulfillment with backlog: for each product, customer/region, week, and scenario, total shipments across facilities from sellable states S_sell plus backlog equals demand d_{p,c,t}. Service level constraint: backlog is limited so that B_{p,c,t}^{xi}  <=  (1 − alpha_{p,c,t}) d_{p,c,t}. Sales allowed states only: shipments from states not in S_sell are zero. Initial inventory: for each product, facility, and state, initial inventory at t = 1 is given and identical across scenarios, I_{p,f,s,1}^{xi} = I0_{p,f,s}. Nonnegativity and integrality: all flow and inventory variables are nonnegative and line activations are binary, with procurement and activations chosen before scenarios are realized and held common across scenarios.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Consider a rectangular N_x-by-N_y lattice of nodes indexed by (i, j) with i = 1, ... , N_x and j = 1, ... , N_y. Let I denote the interior nodes { (i, j) : 1 < i < N_x, 1 < j < N_y }, B the boundary nodes (the complement of I), and C the four corners { (1,1), (1,N_y), (N_x,1), (N_x,N_y) }. Each node (i, j) has given lower and upper bounds L_{i,j}  <=  U_{i,j}.

Corner-value extremization activation: exactly one corner is selected to take its upper bound, enforced by ∑_{c in C} y^{C}_{c} = 1. Corner consistency: for each corner c  in  C, the boundary indicator matches the corner selector (y_{i,j} = y^{C}_{c} when (i, j) = c), and for all non-corner boundary nodes (i, j)  in  B \\ C, the boundary indicator is fixed to 0 so those nodes take their lower bounds.

All decision variables are continuous, nonnegative dollar amounts. The expected net economic surplus per dollar invested in each category is given by profit coefficients p_H, p_R, p_T, p_W, p_P, p_Z, p_B, and p_F. The total capital budget available after fixed obligations is B_max. A statutory minimum dollar allocation to Affordable Housing is H_min.

Each category has an annual delivery capacity U_H, U_R, U_T, U_W, U_P, U_Z, U_B, and U_F that limits productive spending in the year.

      "Title: Carbon-Minimizing Multi-Modal Livestock Transfer with Time-Window and Welfare Constraints\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: A rangeland cooperative must move an entire herd of H head from the origin property to a destination property across canyon terrain using a two-leg, multi-modal chain: trucks carry animals from the origin to a staging area, and helicopters shuttle animals from staging to the destination. The planning horizon is discretized into time buckets U. The feasible truck trips are indexed by T and the feasible helicopter shuttles by J; each trip j or i has a capacity (K^H_j, K^T_i), duration (d^H_j, d^T_i), and a permissible departure window [A^H_j, B^H_j] or [A^T_i, B^T_i]. The decision variables are: u_i and v_j, binary activation indicators for truck trip i and helicopter shuttle j; x_i and y_j, the nonnegative integer head loaded on truck i and shuttle j; m_{i,j}, the nonnegative integer head from truck i assigned to helicopter j; s^T_i and s^H_j, nonnegative real start times for truck i (departing origin) and helicopter j (departing staging); a^T_{i,t} and a^H_{j,t}, binary flags indicating whether truck i has arrived at staging by time bucket t and whether helicopter j has departed staging by time bucket t; act^T_{i,t} and act^H_{j,t}, binary activity flags indicating whether truck i or helicopter j is active (in transit or loading/unloading) in bucket t; b_{i,j}, a binary indicator equal to 1 if any animals from truck i are assigned to shuttle j; and E, the nonnegative real total greenhouse gas emissions. The objective is to minimize E, where emissions are accounted as E = ∑_{i in T}( alpha ^T_i d^T_i u_i +  beta ^T_i x_i) + ∑_{j in J}( alpha ^H_j d^H_j v_j +  beta ^H_j y_j), with  alpha  and  beta  being fixed and load-dependent emissions coefficients.\n",

      "The herd must be fully moved on both legs: ∑_{i in T} x_i = H and ∑_{j in J} y_j = H. Per-trip capacity and activation are respected: 0  <=  x_i  <=  K^T_i u_i for each i and 0  <=  y_j  <=  K^H_j v_j for each j. Trip count caps enforce seasonal and permit limits: ∑_{i in T} u_i  <=  T_max and ∑_{j in J} v_j  <=  H_max. Batch matching ensures consistency between legs: for each truck i, ∑_{j in J} m_{i,j} = x_i, and for each helicopter j, ∑_{i in T} m_{i,j} = y_j, with m_{i,j} integer and nonnegative. Start times must lie within their respective windows: A^T_i  <=  s^T_i  <=  B^T_i for each i and A^H_j  <=  s^H_j  <=  B^H_j for each j. Time-bucket arrival/departure flags are linked by Big-M formulations and are nondecreasing in time: for trucks, if a^T_{i,t} = 1 then s^T_i + d^T_i  <=  t; for helicopters, if a^H_{j,t} = 1 then s^H_j  <=  t; and a^T_{i,t}  <=  a^T_{i,t+1}, a^H_{j,t}  <=  a^H_{j,t+1} for consecutive buckets. Staging inventory is feasible and respects precedence: for each time bucket t, define Inventory_t = ∑_{i in T} K^T_i a^T_{i,t} − ∑_{j in J} K^H_j a^H_{j,t}, which must satisfy 0  <=  Inventory_t  <=  S_max and cumulative arrivals at staging cannot be less than cumulative departures, i.e., ∑_{i in T} K^T_i a^T_{i,t}  >=  ∑_{j in J} K^H_j a^H_{j,t}. Animal-welfare waiting limits at staging are enforced: for any pair (i, j), if b_{i,j} = 1 then s^H_j − (s^T_i + d^T_i +  tau _load_unload)  <=  W_max; otherwise the constraint is relaxed via a Big-M term, and m_{i,j}  <=  K_link b_{i,j} links batch sizes to the binary match indicator. Crew calendars constrain resources over time: for each bucket t, ∑_{i in T} act^T_{i,t}  <=  Crew_T(t) and ∑_{j in J} act^H_{j,t}  <=  Crew_H(t); activity flags are linked to schedules so that if act^T_{i,t} = 1 then t lies within the truck’s active interval [s^T_i, s^T_i + d^T_i] (enforced via Big-M inequalities), with analogous linking for helicopters. Total monetary cost must not exceed the seasonal budget: ∑_{i in T} Cost^T_i u_i + ∑_{j in J} Cost^H_j v_j  <=  Budget. Finally, continuous travel-time welfare bounds require d^T_i  <=  TravelMax_T for all trucks and d^H_j  <=  TravelMax_H for all helicopters.

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a weekly workforce planning problem across a set of programs P and roles R, with employees stratified into grades G, including distinguished subsets of new graduates G_NewGrad, juniors G_Junior, and seniors G_Senior. For each program–role (p, r), the business specifies required hours D_{p,r} and a minimum staffing threshold L_{p,r}. Each grade g has a base wage w_g, an overtime premium multiplier φ_g  >=  1, a per-hire onboarding cost c^{hire}_g, a current available headcount N_g, and per-employee limits on regular hours H_base and overtime O_cap; H_assign  <=  H_base is an upper bound on the hours that one headcount may be assigned to a single program–role. Eligibility P_{p,r,g}  in  {0,1} indicates whether grade g may perform role r in program p. Senior oversight requirements are parameterized by  alpha _{p,r} (a minimum senior-to-junior hour ratio for each program–role) and  beta  (a global minimum senior oversight ratio relative to new graduate hours). Decisions are: x_{p,r,g}  in  Z_+ = number of grade g headcount assigned to (p, r) for the week; h_{p,r,g}  >=  0 = weekly hours delivered by grade g to (p, r); t_g  in  Z_+ = new hires of grade g providing immediate weekly capacity; and o_g  >=  0 = total overtime hours utilized by grade g. The objective is to minimize total weekly labor cost, equal to regular wages on all delivered hours (sum over p, r, g of w_g h_{p,r,g}), plus the overtime premium on overtime hours (sum over g of (φ_g − 1) w_g o_g), plus hiring/onboarding costs (sum over g of c^{hire}_g t_g), while respecting a fixed executive payroll budget B.\n",

      "The plan must satisfy: for every program–role (p, r), the total delivered hours meet or exceed demand (the sum over grades of h_{p,r,g} is at least D_{p,r}) and the assigned headcount meets the minimum staffing threshold (the sum over grades of x_{p,r,g} is at least L_{p,r}). Hours are linked to eligible headcount via h_{p,r,g}  <=  H_assign P_{p,r,g} x_{p,r,g} for all p, r, g, implying no hours may be delivered where ineligible and, when eligible, per-assignment hours cannot exceed H_assign per assigned headcount. At the grade level, weekly capacity with overtime is enforced by requiring that the total hours delivered by grade g across all programs and roles do not exceed H_base times the available headcount (current plus hires) plus the overtime hours, i.e., the sum over p, r of h_{p,r,g}  <=  H_base (N_g + t_g) + o_g; and overtime is further capped per grade by o_g  <=  O_cap (N_g + t_g). Headcount availability is respected by limiting the total number of assignments per grade to the available headcount, that is, the sum over p, r of x_{p,r,g}  <=  N_g + t_g. Senior oversight is enforced both locally and globally: for each program–role (p, r), total senior hours meet a minimum ratio to junior hours (the sum over g  in  G_Senior of h_{p,r,g} is at least  alpha _{p,r} times the sum over g  in  G_Junior of h_{p,r,g}); and across all programs and roles, total senior hours are at least  beta  times total new graduate hours (the sum over p, r, g  in  G_Senior of h_{p,r,g} is at least  beta  times the sum over p, r, g  in  G_NewGrad of h_{p,r,g}). Finally, the weekly payroll budget is observed by requiring that regular wages plus overtime premiums plus hiring costs do not exceed B, and variable domains are enforced: x_{p,r,g} and t_g are nonnegative integers, while h_{p,r,g} and o_g are nonnegative real values.\n",

For each beach-day, an access indicator specifies whether the beach is usable, and an effective harvestable window (after cleaning/setup) limits hours that can be worked. Beach- and product-specific catch rates convert hours to yields. Each harvesting day incurs an operating cost and is subject to a maximum processing capacity K (kg/day).

Setup‑to‑use linking enforces x_{p,d}  <=  M  *  u_{d,p} so a pattern can run only if it is set up; transition feasibility requires s_{d,p,q}  <=  u_{d,p} and s_{d,p,q}  <=  u_{d,q} so adjacencies occur only between patterns actually set up on the day; and a transition count bound limits, for each day, the total number of adjacencies to at most the number of distinct setups minus one. Minimum passes when used enforce x_{p,d}  >=  MinPass_p  *  u_{d,p}. A warehouse trim waste cap limits the total trim meters across the horizon, the sum of Trim_p times x_{p,d}, to WasteCap. A daily setup limit bounds the number of distinct setups on each day by S_max_d. Finally, pattern feasibility requires that, for every pattern p, the sum across its lanes of width W_i multiplied by lane counts a_{p,i}, plus its total trim Trim_p, equals the master roll width W = 2500 mm, ensuring each knife setup fits the parent roll.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize total parent rolls consumed plus weighted sequence-dependent setup time and overproduction slack, i.e., minimize sum_{d,p} x_{p,d} + alpha * sum_{d,p,q} ST_{p,q} * s_{d,p,q} + sum_{i} lambda_i * o_i.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Plan a one-week cutting schedule on two parallel high-speed rewinders that convert 3.2-meter parent rolls into customer-specified widths using an approved set of feasible cutting patterns. Time is partitioned into ordered buckets (with the last bucket denoted T_end). The given data include, for each pattern and SKU, the rolls yielded per parent roll; for each pattern and machine, the processing time per parent roll; trim loss per parent roll; setup/changeover indicators and times between successive patterns; adjacency feasibility rules; per-bucket caps on parent rolls per pattern; machine uptime per bucket; initial setup time on each machine; cumulative demand due by each bucket; minimum rolls per pallet for each SKU; a warehouse pallet capacity; and nonnegative weights trading off trim loss and changeover penalties. The decision variables are: a binary assignment y[p,m,t] indicating whether pattern p is run on machine m in bucket t; a nonnegative integer n[p,m,t] giving the number of parent rolls of pattern p processed by machine m in bucket t; a binary adjacency indicator u[p,q,m,t] that is 1 if pattern p runs in bucket t−1 and pattern q runs in bucket t on machine m (defined for buckets after the first); a binary changeover indicator z[m,t] that is 1 if a knife/grade/core changeover is required at the start of bucket t on machine m (for buckets after the first); a nonnegative integer r[w] for total rolls produced of SKU w over the horizon; a nonnegative integer p[w] for pallets produced of SKU w; and a nonnegative integer R_total for total parent rolls consumed.\n",

      "The objective is to minimize total parent rolls consumed, plus penalties for trim loss and changeovers: specifically, minimize R_total plus alpha times the sum of pattern-specific trim loss over all processed parent rolls, plus beta times the number of changeovers across machines and buckets after the first. The constraints are: for each machine and bucket, at most one pattern may be assigned (buckets may be idle); for each pattern, machine, and bucket, the number of parent rolls processed is zero unless the pattern is assigned and, when assigned, cannot exceed its per-bucket cap; in the first bucket on each machine, the total processing time of all parent rolls plus the machine’s initial setup time cannot exceed the available uptime; in subsequent buckets, total processing time plus any sequence-dependent setup time implied by the chosen adjacency cannot exceed the available uptime. Adjacency variables are linked to assignments so that u[p,q,m,t] is activated only when pattern p is selected in bucket t−1 and pattern q in bucket t on the same machine; the changeover indicator z[m,t] is activated whenever any selected adjacency between the previous and current patterns requires a changeover and is zero when no adjacency exists. Any prohibited adjacency pair is disallowed: a machine cannot run pattern p in bucket t−1 and pattern q in bucket t if that pairing violates compatibility rules. For each SKU and each bucket, cumulative production up to that bucket (computed from pattern yields and parent rolls processed across both machines) must meet or exceed cumulative demand due by that bucket. Total rolls produced per SKU over the horizon equal that same yield-based sum and must be at least the final due demand; moreover, each SKU’s total rolls must be an integer multiple of its minimum pallet size, and the sum of pallets across all SKUs cannot exceed the warehouse capacity.

Capacity with ramp, shifts, and overtime: class throughput at a DC in a period is bounded by the usable ramped capacity times operational status, u_{d,p,t}  <=   rho _{d,t} * y_{d,t} * (cap_per_shift_{d,p} * s_{d,t} +  beta _{d,p} * o_{d,t}). Shift bounds: staffed shifts cannot exceed the DC’s maximum when operational, s_{d,t}  <=  max_shifts_{d} * y_{d,t}. Overtime bounds: overtime cannot exceed the DC’s per-period limit when operational, o_{d,t}  <=  OT_max_{d} * y_{d,t}. Facility activation: a DC can be operational only if it is existing or commissioned via build or lease, y_{d,t}  <=  y_existing_{d} + z_build_{d} + z_lease_{d}. Build-versus-lease exclusivity: at most one commissioning mode may be chosen, z_build_{d} + z_lease_{d}  <=  1. Service feasibility: assignments must respect distance/time service-level feasibility, a_{s,d,p,t}  <=  feas_{s,d,p}. Cold-chain capability: assignments for each class are permitted only to DCs equipped for that class, a_{s,d,p,t}  <=  cold_capable_{d,p}. Period budget: the sum of build outlays and lease rents across DCs cannot exceed the available capital budget in each period, ∑_{d}(CAPEX_build_{d,t} * z_build_{d} + LeaseRent_{d,t} * z_lease_{d})  <=  BudgetCapex_{t}. Total DC throughput cap: the sum of class throughputs at a DC cannot exceed its physical throughput limit, ∑_{p} u_{d,p,t}  <=  THR_max_{d,t}. Carrier bracket consistency (if piecewise rates are used): for each lane l served from DC d, total shipped volume V_{l,t} equals the sum across brackets V_{l,k,t}; exactly one rate segment is active per DC, ∑_{k} w_{d,k} = 1; and segment volumes are bounded by big-M values tied to activation, V_{l,k,t}  <=  M_{k} * w_{d,k}.\n",

      "Title: Multi-Period Multi-Commodity Plant-to-DC Transport Planning with Carrier Lane Caps and Load Integerization\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a multi-period shipment planning problem over plants, distribution centers (DCs), products (SKUs), carriers, and discrete time periods. For each plant–DC–product–carrier–period, the decision variable x denotes the nonnegative quantity of product units that depart the plant; for each plant–DC–product–carrier–period, r denotes the nonnegative quantity of that product that arrives at the DC (arrivals may lag departures by a transit lead time). For each plant–DC–carrier–period, y is the nonnegative integer number of truckloads booked; inv and b are the nonnegative end-of-period inventory and backorders, respectively, for each DC–product–period; and u and s are the nonnegative unused weight and cube per plant–DC–carrier–period associated with the booked loads. Products have weight and cube per unit, trailers have weight and cube capacity by carrier, plants have time-phased supply, DCs face time-phased demand, and lead times are given by an integer number of periods for each plant–DC lane. The objective is to minimize total logistics cost over the horizon: the sum of per-unit freight tariffs on shipped quantities, per-load fixed charges on booked loads, inventory holding costs on end-of-period inventories, backorder penalty costs on end-of-period backorders, and penalties on unused trailer weight and cube.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feasible plans satisfy the following. Inventory balance with transit lags holds at each DC for each product and period: the current period’s inventory minus backorders equals the prior period’s inventory minus backorders plus total arrivals in the current period from all plants and carriers minus current demand; initial inventory is given and initial backorders are zero. Transit coupling enforces that arrivals equal past departures offset by the lane’s lead time: for any plant–DC–product–carrier–period, arrivals in a period equal the shipment quantity that departed in the period that is exactly the lead time earlier; if that departure period falls before the planning horizon, the corresponding arrival is zero. Plant availability limits ensure that, in each period at each plant and for each product, the total quantity shipped across all DCs and carriers does not exceed the plant’s available supply. Trailer capacity linking enforces load integerization and packing: for each plant–DC–carrier–period, the total shipped weight across products plus unused weight equals the carrier’s per-load weight capacity times the number of loads, and likewise the total shipped cube plus unused cube equals the per-load cube capacity times the number of loads. Carrier lane caps are respected both per period and cumulatively: in any period, loads on a specific plant–DC lane by a given carrier cannot exceed that carrier’s per-period cap for the lane, and across all periods, the sum of loads by that carrier on the lane cannot exceed its cumulative cap. Cross-carrier lane caps are also enforced so that, in any period, the total loads on a plant–DC lane summed over all carriers do not exceed the lane’s overall per-period cap. DC storage capacity is respected each period by requiring that the total cube of end-of-period inventory across all products at a DC does not exceed the DC’s storage cube capacity. All shipment, arrival, inventory, backorder, and unused-capacity variables are nonnegative, and the number of loads is an integer.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize total logistics cost = sum of per-unit freight tariffs, per-load fixed charges, DC holding costs, backorder penalties, and penalties for unused trailer weight/cube capacity, subject to meeting demand over time (with allowed backorders), plant supply limits, carrier lane caps, trailer capacity, and DC storage constraints.\n",

      "Subject to: for each school and day, planned servings across all items must meet or exceed expected reimbursable meal demand; and the total preparation time implied by planned servings does not exceed the school’s kitchen preparation capacity. For each nutrient and week (defined by a specified subset of days), the total amount of that nutrient delivered by all planned servings across all schools and days in the week must lie between the weekly per-student lower and upper bands multiplied by the week’s student-meal denominator, with nonnegative slackLower and slackUpper permitting audited deviations below or above those bands. For each item and day (t  >=  1), end-of-day district inventory equals prior inventory plus all deliveries of that item on that day minus the procurement-equivalent of servings across schools, using item-specific yield to convert servings to units; initial inventories are given. On each day, the total storage volume implied by inventories across all items does not exceed the central storage capacity. For every item–vendor–day, contractual order bounds apply: order quantity is zero if the vendor is not selected, and otherwise lies between the vendor-specific minimum and maximum for that item; optionally, at most one vendor may be selected for any item on any day. For each vendor and day, orders are allowed only if a delivery is scheduled, enforced by linking total order volume to delivery activation via a sufficiently large constant, and deliveries may occur only on days permitted by the vendor’s delivery calendar. Total spending on purchases and delivery fees across the horizon must not exceed the district budget. Finally, for each item–school–day, planned servings cannot exceed operational daily limits and are zero when the item is not seasonally available.\n",

Each vehicle v has a home venue venue[v]. The data include: attendee-to-vehicle preference indicators P[a,v] and attendee availability W[a,s]; vehicle availability windows A[v,s] and venue timetables T[k,s]; instructor capacity I[k,s] per venue-slot; seat capacity cap_v per test drive; initial battery state B0[v], bounds Bmin[v], Bmax[v], per-slot drive energy use e_v, and per-slot charging recovery r_v; a subset V_HP of high-performance vehicles subject to insurance concurrency limits H_max[s]; CRM utility weights U[a,v] for serving attendee a on a vehicle of type v; desired share fractions q_m by trim; and a fairness penalty weight  lambda .

      "The schedule must satisfy the following constraints. Each attendee may receive at most one test-drive slot: for every attendee, the assignments across all vehicles and slots sum to no more than one. An assignment is allowed only if both the attendee accepts the vehicle’s trim/model and is available in the slot: x[a,v,s] can be one only when P[a,v] = 1 and W[a,s] = 1. In any vehicle-slot, the number of assigned attendees cannot exceed the seat capacity and requires activation of the slot: for every vehicle and slot, the total assigned attendees is at most cap_v times y[v,s], so if y[v,s] = 0 no one can be assigned. A vehicle can operate a test drive only when both the vehicle is available and its venue is open in that slot: y[v,s] is zero unless A[v,s] = 1 and T[venue[v],s] = 1. Instructor headcount caps the number of simultaneous test drives per venue and slot: for each venue k and slot s, the sum of y[v,s] over vehicles at that venue does not exceed I[k,s]. Driving and charging are mutually exclusive and govern battery dynamics: for every vehicle and slot, at most one of driving and charging can occur (y[v,s] + c[v,s]  <=  1); the state of charge at the first slot equals B0[v]; from one slot to the next, state of charge updates as next SOC = current SOC minus e_v if driving plus r_v if charging; and SOC must remain within [Bmin[v], Bmax[v]] at all slots. Participation and trim counts are defined consistently: total served P_served equals the total number of assignments across all attendees, vehicles, and slots; for each trim m, F[m] equals the total number of assignments on vehicles belonging to trim m; and for each trim m, the deviation from the target share satisfies F[m] − q_m * P_served =  delta _plus[m] −  delta _minus[m], with  delta _plus[m],  delta _minus[m]  >=  0. Insurance concurrency limits constrain high-performance activity: in each slot, the number of high-performance vehicles running test drives does not exceed H_max[s].

Each item i has category indicators cat_{i,c}, an original pick sequence position posPick_i, and a reordering weight w_reorder_i; each bench b has capacity Cap_b and a minimum anti-starvation requirement smin_b within any sliding window of W consecutive pack positions.

(3) Permutation row sums: for each item i, the sum over k of z_{i,k} equals x_i, so unselected items do not appear and selected items appear exactly once. (4) Permutation column sums: for each position k, the sum over i of z_{i,k} equals 1, so every pack position is occupied by exactly one selected item; together with binary z this enforces that the pack queue is a pure permutation of the selected items. (5) Bench assignment completeness: for each position k, the sum over b of a_{k,b} equals 1, assigning each position to exactly one bench. (6) Bench capacity: for each bench b, the sum over k of a_{k,b} is at most Cap_b. (7) Reordering distance lower bounds: for each item i, d_i is at least the difference between its pack position and posPick_i in both directions, i.e., d_i  >=  (sum over k of k z_{i,k}) − posPick_i and d_i  >=  posPick_i − (sum over k of k z_{i,k}), making d_i the absolute deviation. (8) Reordering distance deactivation: for each item i, d_i  <=  M x_i, so unselected items have zero distance. (9) Bench load definition: for each bench b, load_b equals the sum over k of a_{k,b}.

      "Formal Problem Statement: Given a modulus M, let R = {0,  ... , M−1} denote residue classes and B = {0,  ... , M−1} denote buckets. For each residue class r  in  R we are given an estimated record count N[r] and a baseline assignment y0[r,b] indicating the bucket b  in  B to which r is currently routed. Routing feasibility is specified by a binary matrix Allow[r,b] that is 1 only if residue r may be routed to bucket b. A subset InactiveBuckets  subset of  B must remain unused. Each bucket b has a physical capacity U[b] and a quota range qmin[b]  <=  q[b]  <=  qmax[b]. The total number of active buckets must lie between Kmin and Kmax, and the total number of residue reassignments is limited by a churn budget Cmax. The decision variables are: z[b]  in  {0,1} indicating whether bucket b is active; y[r,b]  in  {0,1} indicating whether residue r is routed to bucket b; L[b]  >=  0 the integer load assigned to bucket b; q[b]  >=  0 the integer quota chosen for bucket b; Lmax  >=  0 and Lmin  >=  0 the integer maximum and minimum loads across buckets; Delta  >=  0 the integer worst-case imbalance; and d[r]  in  {0,1} indicating whether residue r is reassigned relative to the baseline.\n",

      "The objective is to minimize the worst-case imbalance Delta = Lmax − Lmin across buckets; optionally, ties are broken by minimizing the total rebalancing churn ∑r d[r]. The constraints are: every residue class is assigned to exactly one bucket, i.e., for each r, the sum over b of y[r,b] equals 1; a residue can be routed to a bucket only if that bucket is active and the route is allowed, i.e., y[r,b]  <=  z[b] and y[r,b]  <=  Allow[r,b] for all r and b; loads are induced by the assignment, i.e., for each b, L[b] equals the sum over r of N[r] * y[r,b]; each bucket’s load respects capacity and quota, i.e., for each b, L[b]  <=  U[b], L[b]  <=  q[b], and qmin[b]  <=  q[b]  <=  qmax[b]; the number of active buckets lies within bounds, i.e., Kmin  <=  ∑b z[b]  <=  Kmax; buckets designated inactive must be unused, i.e., z[b] = 0 for all b  in  InactiveBuckets; Lmax and Lmin bound all bucket loads, i.e., Lmax  >=  L[b] and Lmin  <=  L[b] for every b; the imbalance variable is valid, i.e., Delta  >=  Lmax − Lmin; the reassignment indicator matches the deviation from the baseline, i.e., for each r, d[r] equals one half of the sum over b of the absolute differences |y[r,b] − y0[r,b]| (so d[r] = 1 if and only if r moves to a different bucket); and the churn budget is enforced, i.e., the sum over r of d[r] is at most Cmax.\n",

Each crew member c has qualifications Qcat_{c,k} and Qeq_{c,e} in {0,1} indicating eligibility for category k and equipment e, a maximum workload MaxDuty_c, and is associated with a legacy diversity operator code op_code_c in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} and a category diversity threshold T_c; optionally, an equipment diversity operator code op_code_eq_c and threshold U_c may be specified.

Non-overlap and daily capacity: for each crew c and day t, at most one duty scheduled on day t may be assigned to c; furthermore, no pair of overlapping duties may both be assigned to the same crew (if overlap(d1,d2)=1, then y_{c,d1}+y_{c,d2}  <=  1 for all c). Qualification: a crew may be assigned to a duty only if qualified for both its category and equipment (y_{c,d}  <=  Qcat_{c,cat(d)} and y_{c,d}  <=  Qeq_{c,eq(d)}). Roster linkage with sentinel: for each crew c and period t, r_{c,t} equals the category of the uniquely assigned duty on day t if any, and equals 0 otherwise; r_{c,t} is restricted to {0}  union  K. Distinct active category count ignoring 0: for each crew c, nDistinct_c equals the number of distinct values among r_{c,1}, ... ,r_{c,H} after excluding the sentinel value 0; repeated occurrences of the same nonzero category across periods increase this count only once, and sentinel 0 never contributes. Legacy operator-code mapping for category diversity: map op_code_c as follows −2 to “<”, −1 to “ <= ”, 0 to “=”, 1 to “ >= ”, 2 to “>”, and enforce nDistinct_c (Rel(op_code_c)) T_c. Optional equipment diversity: define nEquipDistinct_c as the number of distinct equipment types among duties with y_{c,d}=1 and enforce nEquipDistinct_c (Rel(op_code_eq_c)) U_c using the same operator mapping if provided. Workload bound: for each crew c, the total number of assigned duties does not exceed MaxDuty_c.

Decision variables are: a[s,r,t]  in  {0,1}, which is 1 if session s is assigned to room r at slot t; y[s]  in  {0,1}, which is 1 if session s is scheduled; x[s]  in  R and tau[s]  in  T, the chosen room and time slot for s (meaningful only when y[s]=1); for each category c and slot t, z_c[t]  in  {0,1}, which is 1 if any room in category c is used at t; and S_c  subset of  T, the audit set of slot indices where category c is used.\n",

      "The following constraints must hold. Each session is assigned to exactly one room-slot if scheduled, and to none otherwise: the sum of a[s,r,t] over rooms r and feasible slots t equals y[s]. Mandatory sessions must be scheduled: if optional[s]=0 then y[s]=1. No room may host more than one session in any slot: for every room r and slot t, the sum over s of a[s,r,t] is at most 1. Assignment decisions link to the chosen room and slot: if a[s,r,t]=1 then x[s]=r and tau[s]=t. Assignments must respect feasibility and capacity: if a[s,r,t]=1 then t  in  candidateSlots[s] and enroll[s]  <=  cap[r].

Market settlement windows are given by a collection W_market of (possibly overlapping) subsets of T with lower and upper bounds C_min_W and C_max_W (kWh). For each feeder f, W_feeder(f) specifies rolling windows with caps Cap_{f,W} (kWh). Aggregate ramp limits are R_up and R_down (kW per interval). For each device i, W_comfort(i) defines rolling comfort windows with per-window caps  alpha _{i,W} on the count of control actions. Messaging throughput at time t is limited by MsgCap_t.

Each job j consists of an ordered set of checkpointed, non-divisible segments K_j, where segment (j,k) requires a fixed duration d_{j,k} and a fixed GPU demand g_{j,k}. Decision variables are: the integer start time S_{j,k} in T for every segment; binary activity indicators z_{j,k,t} that equal 1 exactly when segment (j,k) is running in slot t; nonnegative integer GPU allocations x_{j,k,r} giving the number of GPUs of segment (j,k) assigned to rack r in R; binary preemption indicators y_{j,k} that equal 1 if a positive gap precedes segment k of job j; binary start indicators s_{j,k,t} that equal 1 if segment (j,k) starts in slot t; the job completion time C_j = S_{j,|K_j|} + d_{j,|K_j|}; the campaign makespan M (the maximum completion time across jobs); and the nonnegative tardiness T_j of each job relative to its due date D_j. All time quantities are measured in slots.

      "The schedule must satisfy the following constraints. Segment activity linking: each segment (j,k) occupies exactly d_{j,k} consecutive time slots starting at S_{j,k}; z_{j,k,t} equals 1 if and only if t lies between S_{j,k} and S_{j,k} + d_{j,k} − 1 inclusive, and 0 otherwise. GPU demand per segment: for every segment, the total GPUs allocated across racks equals g_{j,k}, with x_{j,k,r} integral and nonnegative. Rack GPU capacity: for every rack r and time slot t, the total GPUs from all segments active in t assigned to r does not exceed RackGPULimit[r]. Data center power cap: for every time slot t, the sum over active segments of their allocated GPUs weighted by phi_r across racks does not exceed P_cap[t]. Thermal envelope: for every time slot t, the sum over active segments of their allocated GPUs weighted by h_r across racks does not exceed ThermalCap[t]. Blackout exclusion: no segment may be active in any blackout slot t in B, i.e., z_{j,k,t} = 0 for all such t. Segment order and checkpointed preemption: for each job and consecutive segments, the start of segment k+1 must follow the completion of segment k, and if a preemption occurs before k+1 (y_{j,k+1} = 1) a cold-start overhead tau_j is added, specifically S_{j,k+1}  >=  S_{j,k} + d_{j,k} + tau_j y_{j,k+1}.

Start linkage: each segment chooses exactly one start slot, with sum over t of s_{j,k,t} equal to 1 and S_{j,k} equal to the unique t for which s_{j,k,t} = 1. Staffing start-rate cap: in every time slot t, the number of segment starts does not exceed StartLimit[t], i.e., the sum over all s_{j,k,t} is bounded by StartLimit[t]. Staffing active segments cap: in every time slot t, the sum of staffing units u_{j,k} across all segments active in t does not exceed StaffLimit[t]. Release dates: the first segment of each job cannot start before its release date, so S_{j,1}  >=  rel_j. Dependencies: for every precedence arc (i  to  j) with minimal lag L_ij, job j cannot start until job i completes plus the lag, i.e., S_{j,1}  >=  S_{i,|K_i|} + d_{i,|K_i|} + L_ij. Job completion and makespan: C_j is defined as the end time of the last segment of job j, and the makespan M is at least every C_j.

(2) Irreflexive and one-way precedence: for all i, M[i,i] = 0; for all distinct i  !=  j, M[i,j] + M[j,i]  <=  1. (3) Activated score margins on asserted precedence: for all i  !=  j, s[i] − s[j] + B(1 − M[i,j])  >=   delta  − e[i,j], where  delta  > 0 is the required minimum margin when M[i,j] = 1, B is a sufficiently large constant to deactivate the constraint when M[i,j] = 0, and e[i,j]  >=  0 captures any margin shortfall. (4) Acyclicity via topological levels: for all i  !=  j, t[i]  >=  t[j] + 1 − N(1 − M[i,j]); with t[i] integer, this ensures a valid topological order (no directed cycles) consistent with M.

Each job t has a positive integer duration dur_t and may overlap in time with certain other jobs; the set O contains all unordered pairs (t,u) with overlapping time windows. Technician i can perform job t only if C[i,t]=1, and each technician i has an integer workload capacity cap_i. Let a in {1, ... ,n} be a predetermined technician index to anchor the least-loaded end, and let strict_argmax, strict_argmin in {0,1} control strictness of the extreme-value selections. The decision variables are: x_t in {1, ... ,n} for each job t, indicating the assigned technician; w_i in Z >= 0 for each technician i, denoting total workload (sum of durations of jobs assigned to i); Wmax in Z >= 0, the maximum workload across technicians; k_max in {1, ... ,n}, the index of a technician achieving Wmax selected by a smallest-index tie-break; y_i in {0,1}, equal to 1 if and only if w_i=Wmax; and r_i in {1, ... ,n}, the strict rank of technician i by workload after breaking ties by increasing technician index (1 is the smallest).

Ranking consistency: the ranks (r_1, ... ,r_n) are all distinct; whenever w_i<w_j, then r_i<r_j; and for equal workloads, ties are broken by index so that if i<j and w_i=w_j, then r_i<r_j; additionally, r_a=1.\n",

The decision variables are: x_{v,t} (nonnegative integers) for the number of TEU moves executed for vessel v in window t; a_{k,v,t} (binary) indicating whether crane k is assigned to vessel v in window t; u_{k,d} (binary) indicating whether crane k is utilized on day d; r_{k,d} (binary, for k in K_r) indicating whether rental crane k is rented on day d; g_d (nonnegative integers) for the number of union gangs scheduled on day d; u_d (nonnegative integers) for TEU unloaded from rail on day d; m_{b,d}^{in} and m_{b,d}^{out} (nonnegative integers) for TEU moved into and out of yard block b on day d; y_{b,d} (nonnegative integers) for end-of-day TEU inventory in block b on day d (with initial inventory y_{b,0} given); s_{v,t} (binary) indicating whether vessel v is worked in window t; and o_d (nonnegative) for overtime capacity on day d. The objective is to minimize total operating cost over the horizon, comprising crane rental fees, union gang labor and overtime costs, demurrage and storage tariffs based on block inventories and dwell relative to free-time, and penalties for exceeding daily yard occupancy thresholds, missing carrier commitments, and deferring planned vessel pulls outside intended windows, subject to operational and capacity constraints described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy vessel commitments across allowed windows: for each vessel v, the sum of moves across t in W_v must meet or exceed Commit_v. Window throughput is bounded by assigned crane capacity: for each vessel-window (v,t), x_{v,t} cannot exceed the sum over cranes k of their rated capacity cap_{k,t} multiplied by assignment a_{k,v,t}. Crane exclusivity within a window is enforced so that, for each crane-window (k,t), the total assignments ∑_v a_{k,v,t} do not exceed the crane’s utilization u_{k,d(t)} that day; rental cranes can be assigned only if rented, i.e., for k in K_r and all (v,t), a_{k,v,t}  <=  r_{k,d(t)}; and daily rental volume is capped by the vendor, ∑_{k in K_r} r_{k,d}  <=  VendorCap_d for each day d. Union gangs must cover utilized cranes, requiring g_d  >=  ∑_{k in K}  gamma _k  *  u_{k,d}, and gang availability imposes g_d  <=  GangCap_d. Daily rail unloads are limited by both infrastructure and arrivals, so u_d  <=  UnloadCap_d and u_d  <=  Arrivals_d for each day. Yard flow conservation links rail and vessel operations: on each day d, the total inbound yard moves ∑_b m_{b,d}^{in} equal u_d, and the total outbound yard moves ∑_b m_{b,d}^{out} equal the sum of vessel moves scheduled that day, ∑_{(v,t): d(t)=d} x_{v,t}. Inventory balances hold in each block: y_{b,d} = y_{b,d−1} + m_{b,d}^{in} − m_{b,d}^{out} for d  >=  1, with y_{b,0} = y0_b. Safety and occupancy constraints require, for each block and day, y_{b,d}  <=  Cells_b  *  H_b (ground slots times maximum stack height), and globally ∑_b y_{b,d}  <=  YardThreshold_d each day. Berth-window activation is linked by a big-M: for each (v,t), x_{v,t}  <=  M_window  *  s_{v,t}, and s_{v,t} must be zero if t is not in W_v. A budget cap limits equipment and labor spend: the sum over days of [∑_{k in K_r} CostRent_{k,d}  *  r_{k,d} + CostGang_d  *  g_d + CostOT_d  *  o_d] must not exceed EquipmentBudget. Maintenance downtime limits assignments: for each (k,t), ∑_v a_{k,v,t}  <=  Avail_{k,t}, where Avail_{k,t}  in  {0,1} indicates crane availability in window t. Leased blocks must be fully cleared at the horizon end, y_{b,D_end} = 0 for all b in B_lease; and legacy inventory must be reduced by Month1End so that ∑_b y_{b,Month1End}  <=  LegacyResidualMax. All integer and binary variables adhere to their stated domains, and continuous variables are nonnegative.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize total operating cost over the planning horizon, including crane rental fees, labor (union gangs and overtime), vessel delay penalties, demurrage and storage tariffs from yard dwell, penalties for exceeding yard occupancy/daily thresholds, and penalties for missed carrier commitments, subject to meeting berth windows, rated crane capacities, rail unload capabilities, safety stack-height limits, and end-of-horizon block clearing requirements.\n",
      "Expected Output: An operating plan with: (1) daily rail unload targets u_{d}; (2) vessel-window move targets x_{v,t}; (3) crane rental and utilization schedule r_{k,d}, u_{k,d}, and assignments a_{k,v,t}; (4) union gang roster g_{d} and overtime o_{d}; (5) yard block allocations m_{b,d}^{in}, m_{b,d}^{out}, and resulting inventories y_{b,d}; (6) confirmation of clearing leased blocks; and (7) total cost with breakdowns (rental, labor, demurrage/storage, penalties), plus KPI summaries (cost per TEU, vessel turnaround adherence, yard occupancy/dwell metrics).\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider the integrated scheduling of all routed operations for a portfolio of aerospace jobs across heterogeneous machines (mills, lathes, CMMs, heat-treat, anodize) under shared auxiliary resources, fixtures, and maintenance calendars. For each operation o, continuous start and completion times S_o, C_o  >=  0 are to be chosen; x_{o,m}  in  {0,1} assigns o to exactly one eligible machine m  in  M(o); y_{o,o',m}  in  {0,1} sequences pairs of operations o and o' that might share machine m; z_{o,o',m}  in  {0,1} activates sequence-dependent changeover on m when both o and o' are assigned there; a_{o,d}  in  {0,1} indicates whether o is active in calendar bucket/day d; a_{o,d,m}  in  {0,1} indicates activity of o in day d specifically on machine m; u_{d,m}  >=  0 is overtime hours allocated to machine m on day d; r_{o,m,r}  in  {0,1} selects “before” versus “after” relative to preventive maintenance window r on machine m; y^{crane}_{o,o'}  in  {0,1} sequences pairs of crane-using operations; and T_j  >=  0 is the tardiness of job j relative to its contractual due date. Given calibrated processing times p_{o,m}, sequence-dependent setup durations s_{fam(o),fam(o'),m}, router queue-time bounds minQueue_{j,k} and maxQueue_{j,k}, maintenance window start and end times for each machine (a_{m,r}, b_{m,r}), calendar bucket boundaries (tau_d, tau_{d+1}), fixture counts F_f for fixture types f and the set Ops_f requiring each fixture, regular shift capacity L_{d,m}, a total overtime budget OT_budget, due dates Due_j, priority weights w_j, and penalty weights alpha and beta, the objective is to minimize the sum over jobs of w_j * T_j plus alpha times the total overtime ∑_{d,m} u_{d,m} plus beta times the total activated changeovers ∑_{(o,o',m)} z_{o,o',m}.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schedule must satisfy: assignment of each operation to exactly one eligible machine (∑_{m in M(o)} x_{o,m} = 1); processing time mapping so that C_o equals S_o plus the processing time on the selected machine, enforced by the lower bound C_o  >=  S_o + ∑_{m in M(o)} p_{o,m} * x_{o,m} and an upper bound C_o  <=  S_o + ∑_{m in M(o)} p_{o,m} * x_{o,m} + M_proc * (1 − ∑_{m in M(o)} x_{o,m}), which tightens to equality when an assignment is made. Machine non-overlap with sequence-dependent setups is enforced for any pair of distinct operations o and o' that can share machine m: if y_{o,o',m} = 1 (o precedes o' on m), then o' must start no earlier than o’s completion plus the applicable changeover s_{fam(o),fam(o'),m} when both are on m, i.e., S_{o'}  >=  C_o + ∑_{m} s_{fam(o),fam(o'),m} * z_{o,o',m} − M_seq * (1 − y_{o,o',m}); symmetrically, if y_{o,o',m} = 0 (o' precedes o), then S_o  >=  C_{o'} + ∑_{m} s_{fam(o'),fam(o),m} * z_{o',o,m} − M_seq * y_{o,o',m}. Sequencing is linked to assignment via y_{o,o',m}  <=  x_{o,m} and y_{o,o',m}  <=  x_{o',m}, and the changeover indicator is linearized via z_{o,o',m}  <=  x_{o,m}, z_{o,o',m}  <=  x_{o',m}, and z_{o,o',m}  >=  x_{o,m} + x_{o',m} − 1 so that changeover time is only applied when both operations are on m. Router precedence and queue-time windows are respected for each job j and consecutive routed operations k: the successor’s start must be at least minQueue_{j,k} after the predecessor’s completion (S_{o_{j,k+1}}  >=  C_{o_{j,k}} + minQueue_{j,k}) and no more than maxQueue_{j,k} after it (S_{o_{j,k+1}}  <=  C_{o_{j,k}} + maxQueue_{j,k}). Preventive maintenance disjunctions ensure that, if operation o is assigned to machine m, it either completes before the start of maintenance window r (C_o  <=  a_{m,r} + M_maint * r_{o,m,r}) or starts after the window ends (S_o  >=  b_{m,r} − M_maint * (1 − r_{o,m,r})), with r_{o,m,r}  <=  x_{o,m}. The single shared crane has capacity one: for any pair of crane-using operations o and o', the sequence variable y^{crane}_{o,o'} enforces non-overlap via S_{o'}  >=  C_o − M_crane * (1 − y^{crane}_{o,o'}) and S_o  >=  C_{o'} − M_crane * y^{crane}_{o,o'}. Fixture capacity is limited per day bucket: for each fixture type f and day d, the number of operations requiring f that are active in d satisfies ∑_{o in Ops_f} a_{o,d}  <=  F_f. Bucket occupancy is linked to time: if a_{o,d} = 1, the operation’s interval [S_o, C_o] overlaps the bucket [tau_d, tau_{d+1}] via S_o  <=  tau_{d+1} + M_time * (1 − a_{o,d}) and C_o  >=  tau_d − M_time * (1 − a_{o,d}). Machine/day activity is consistent with assignment and bucket activity through a_{o,d,m}  <=  x_{o,m}, a_{o,d,m}  <=  a_{o,d}, and a_{o,d,m}  >=  x_{o,m} + a_{o,d} − 1. Per-day capacity with overtime holds for each day d and machine m: the total processing time of operations assigned to m and active in d, ∑_{o} p_{o,m} * x_{o,m} * a_{o,d,m}, does not exceed regular capacity L_{d,m} plus planned overtime u_{d,m}. The total overtime is bounded by the budget, ∑_{d,m} u_{d,m}  <=  OT_budget. Finally, job tardiness is defined by T_j  >=  C_{last(j)} − Due_j and T_j  >=  0 for all jobs, and the schedule must minimize the stated objective while satisfying all constraints.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Patrol Officer Two-Shift Tour Scheduling with Start Costs and Overtime Control. Given a set of officers O, precincts P, and an ordered set of shift slots K over the planning horizon (with adjacency defining consecutive slots), plan a weekly patrol roster in which every tour spans exactly two consecutive shift slots. Parameters include officer availability A_{o,k}, minimum required coverage M_{p,k}, available patrol vehicles V_{p,k}, slot durations L_k, per-start costs C^{start}_k, officer-specific overtime cost rates C^{ot}_o, under-coverage penalties C^{under}_{p,k}, base hours H^{base}_o, and maximum hours H^{max}_o. Decision variables are: x_{o,k}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether officer o starts a two-shift tour at slot k; a_{o,k}  in  {0,1}, indicating whether officer o is active in slot k; b_{o,p,k}  in  {0,1}, indicating assignment of officer o to precinct p in slot k; s_k  in  ℤ_{ >= 0}, the number of starts in slot k; u_{p,k}  >=  0, the under-coverage slack for precinct p in slot k; and h_o  >=  0, the overtime hours of officer o over the horizon. The objective is to minimize total staffing cost equal to the sum over slots of per-start costs (C^{start}_k s_k), plus the sum over officers of overtime costs (C^{ot}_o h_o), plus the sum over precincts and slots of under-coverage penalties (C^{under}_{p,k} u_{p,k}).\n",
      "\n",
      "The schedule must satisfy the following constraints. Two-shift continuity: an officer is active in slot k if and only if they start a tour in slot k or started in the immediately preceding slot, i.e., a_{o,k} = x_{o,k} + x_{o,k−1}, with x_{o,0} = 0 to anchor the horizon. No overlapping tours: an officer may not start tours in consecutive slots, i.e., x_{o,k} + x_{o,k+1}  <=  1 for all consecutive k, and no starts are allowed in the final slot (x_{o,K} = 0) to ensure tours complete within the horizon. Availability enforcement: an officer can only work or start when available; specifically, a_{o,k}  <=  A_{o,k}, and any start at k requires availability in both slots of the tour, x_{o,k}  <=  A_{o,k} and x_{o,k}  <=  A_{o,k+1}. Assignment completeness and exclusivity: in each slot, every active officer is assigned to exactly one precinct, ∑_{p in P} b_{o,p,k} = a_{o,k}. Coverage with allowed shortfall: in each precinct and slot, assigned officers plus nonnegative slack must meet or exceed the minimum required coverage, ∑_{o in O} b_{o,p,k} + u_{p,k}  >=  M_{p,k}. Vehicle capacity: assigned officers in a precinct and slot may not exceed available vehicles, ∑_{o in O} b_{o,p,k}  <=  V_{p,k}. Start count definition: s_k equals the total number of starts in slot k, s_k = ∑_{o in O} x_{o,k}. Hours and overtime accounting: for each officer, overtime is at least the excess of total working hours over base hours and is nonnegative, h_o  >=  ∑_{k in K} L_k a_{o,k} − H^{base}_o and h_o  >=  0, and total working hours cannot exceed the maximum allowed, ∑_{k in K} L_k a_{o,k}  <=  H^{max}_o.

Prerequisites are respected by placing any course only in a term strictly after its prerequisites: for every pair (p,c) and every term t, x_{c,t} can be 1 only if p has been placed in some earlier term (x_{c,t}  <=  sum_{tau < t} x_{p,tau}). Per-term academic load limits are enforced by bounding both credits and course counts: for each term t, the total credits of scheduled courses lies between L_t and U_t, and the number of scheduled courses lies between m_t and M_t. The per-term workload is defined by the scheduled courses’ weights, W_t = sum_c w_c * x_{c,t}, and the peak workload satisfies W_max  >=  W_t for all t. Absolute deviations from the target are linearized by d_t  >=  W_t − W_target and d_t  >=  W_target − W_t for each term. The offering calendar restricts placements: a course may be scheduled in term t only if permitted (x_{c,t}  <=  A_{c,t}).

An industrial robotics integrator must plan weekly purchases for a set of items I from suppliers S over weeks T to meet deterministic item demands D_{i,t} with given initial inventories Inv0_i and item–supplier lead times L_{i,s}. Each supplier s quotes unit prices p_{i,s} with discounts d_{i,s}, per-unit surcharges σ_{i,s}, a flat delivery fee F_s that is waived if a free‑shipping order‑value threshold TH_s is met, and a per‑shipment carrier surcharge H_s. Items may have supplier‑specific minimum order quantities MOQ_{i,s}, suppliers may enforce a minimum order value MOV_s per shipment, and only approved suppliers A_i may be used for each item. The warehouse has a per‑week receiving capacity Cap_t measured in effort units r_i per received unit, and there may be a limit NPO^{max}_t on the number of purchase orders issued in week t. Decisions each week t are: x_{i,s,t} (nonnegative integer) quantities of item i ordered from supplier s; l_{i,s,t} (binary) whether the item–supplier line is active; y_{s,t} (binary) whether a consolidated purchase order is placed to supplier s; z_{s,t} (binary) whether the free‑shipping threshold is attained for supplier s; v_{s,t} (nonnegative continuous) the pre‑surcharge monetary value of items ordered from s; inv_{i,t} (nonnegative, integer or continuous) on‑hand inventory of item i at the end of week t; and R_{i,t} (nonnegative, integer or continuous) receipts of item i in week t (arrivals after lead times).

Receipts in week t for an item equal the sum of the quantities ordered from all suppliers in week t minus the applicable lead time, for those item–supplier pairs whose lead‑time offset lands within the planning horizon. No shortages are allowed: all ending inventories must be nonnegative. Line‑item activation links to ordered quantities via minimum and maximum bounds: if l_{i,s,t}=1 then x_{i,s,t} must be at least MOQ_{i,s}; if l_{i,s,t}=0 then x_{i,s,t}=0, enforced by an upper bound M_{i,s,t} times l_{i,s,t}.

Warehouse receiving capacity is respected: in each week, the total receiving effort of all arrivals (measured as r_i times the units that arrive that week) cannot exceed Cap_t.

Distance is measured in a weighted Euclidean norm defined by a positive diagonal matrix W = diag(w_I, w_V, w_T), so that the margin along facet i scales with ||W^{-1} a_i||_2. Additional parameters include physical bounds I_min  <=  x_I  <=  I_max, V_min  <=  x_V  <=  V_max, T_min  <=  x_T  <=  T_max; coupling envelope coefficients  alpha 0,  alpha 1;  beta 0,  beta 1,  beta 2;  gamma 0,  gamma 1; and a temperature-derated current limit defined by I_nom, k_T, AmbientTemp, and T_ref.\n",

Each SKU s follows a fixed routing with processing hours per unit h_{s,m} on machine m where required (routing incidence a_{s,m}), setup time  tau _{s,m} and setup cost setup_cost_{s,m} when a machine is set up for that SKU, and an integer lot size b_s. Base machine-hours H_base_{m,t} in month t are reduced by planned maintenance Downtime_{m,t}; overtime OT_{m,t} may be purchased up to OTmax_{m,t} at cost overtime_cost_m. Shipments earn unit contribution margins cm_{s,c} by SKU and channel, are limited by per-channel caps cap_{s,c,t}, and must respect a monthly strategic share  alpha _t. Inventory incurs a per-unit monthly carrying cost carry_cost_s, must meet minimum month-end buffers B_{s,t}, and consumes storage space v_s against warehouse capacity W_t.

For each publisher-format pair (p,f), inputs include: cost per 1000 clicks c_{p,f}, a maximum available clicks cap_{p,f}, a block size b_{p,f} (clicks per purchasable block), a maximum purchasable blocks Ymax_{p,f}, a minimum order quantity MOQ_{p,f} (in blocks), an estimated age-share vector s_{p,f,a} (summing to 1 over a in A), expected revenue per click r_{p,f}, and click quality weight q_{p,f}. Campaign-level inputs include: a uniform unique visitor rate u (uniques per click), a minimum total uniques U_min, lower and upper bounds L_a and U_a on each age segment’s share of delivery, a minimum uniques requirement Umin_a for each age segment, a revenue floor R_min, a minimum average quality q_min, and a budget ceiling B_max.

The objective is to minimize total spend, equal to the sum over (p,f) of (c_{p,f}/1000) times x_{p,f}. The purchase granularity is enforced by requiring the clicks equal blocks times block size (x_{p,f} equals b_{p,f} times y_{p,f}). Activation and supply are linked so that no clicks are bought unless the line is active and within supply: 0  <=  x_{p,f}  <=  cap_{p,f} when z_{p,f}=1, and zero otherwise.

Batch-to-start assignment requires, for each type and size option, that the total number of starts across all ovens and time slots equals b_{t,k}.

Time is discretized into operating-room (OR) slots T at centers K, and chains may extend up to positions 1..L. The binary decision variables are: x_c indicating whether cycle c  in  C2  union  C3 is selected; y_{e,h} indicating whether edge e  in  E is used at chain position h  in  {1, ... ,L}; s_{v,t} indicating whether node v  in  V is scheduled in time slot t  in  T; z_{c,t} indicating whether cycle c is executed simultaneously in slot t; u_v indicating whether node v is matched (in a cycle or chain); r_{k,t} indicating whether a contingency OR reserve block is held at center k  in  K in slot t; and b_e indicating whether a backup kidney is reserved for edge e.

Consistency of matching: for each node v, u_v equals the sum of selected cycles that contain v plus the sum of chain edges entering v over all positions; and each node can be used at most once (u_v  <=  1). Chain feasibility: for each node v and each position h  >=  2, the number of edges entering v at position h equals the number of edges leaving v at position h−1, ensuring flow continuity; each NDD s  in  S initiates at most one outgoing edge at position 1, and each recipient has at most one incoming edge at position 1. Scheduling: each node is scheduled in exactly one time slot if and only if it is matched (for all v, the sum over t of s_{v,t} equals u_v); selected cycles must be executed simultaneously in exactly one slot (for each cycle c, the surgeries of all its nodes occur together in a single slot t via z_{c,t}, and c is scheduled in some slot if and only if x_c = 1). OR capacity: for each center k and slot t, the number of surgeries scheduled at that center in that slot does not exceed the available capacity after subtracting any reserved contingency block (cap_{k,t} − r_{k,t}). Logistics timing for any used chain edge e at position h: the transplant time at the recipient (head(e)) minus the donor nephrectomy time at the donor (tail(e)) must be at least the minimum shipping time and at most the cold ischemia time (CIT) limit; the donor surgery time must fall within a given departure window [a_e, b_e], and the recipient surgery time must fall within an arrival window [c_e, d_e]; these timing constraints are enforced only if y_{e,h} = 1 and are otherwise relaxed via a big-M formulation.

Similarly, dock handling is limited by trailer-equivalent capacity: the sum over markets and modes of TrailerEquiv[m] times x[i,j,m] cannot exceed DockCap[i] * y[i]. Whenever a DC is staffed, it must meet union/lease minimum throughput, so its total annual flow must be at least MinVol[i] * y[i]. The network must be resilient, operating at least MinActiveNodes DCs, and finance policy imposes a hard overhead ceiling: the sum of FixedFee[i] over all operated DCs is at most OverheadCap. Fixed lane handling charges apply only when the lane is used and the origin DC is active, enforced by x[i,j,m]  <=  BigM[i,j,m] * w[i,j,m] and w[i,j,m]  <=  y[i]. Service-level feasibility is ensured by a reach mask: for each lane (i,j,m), flow is permitted only if the lane meets transit-time requirements, implemented as x[i,j,m]  <=  Feasible[i,j,m] * D[j], where Feasible[i,j,m] equals 1 when TT[i,j]  <=  SLA[j] and 0 otherwise. Zone-skipping can be used for a market only when enrolled and sufficiently consolidated: for each j, the total ZS volume satisfies ∑i x[i,j,ZS]  >=  ZSThreshold[j] *  delta [j] and ∑i x[i,j,ZS]  <=  D[j] *  delta [j]. Mode exclusivity is not required; if a policy mandates exactly one mode per market, all demand for market j must be carried by the chosen mode, enforceable by appropriate binary selections and the same demand-equality constraint above.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Formal Problem Statement: Plan a multi-year capacity expansion and financing schedule for a set of generation technologies (coal, nuclear, gas, renewables, and a fixed legacy oil fleet) over a planning horizon of years. The decision variables are: x_{g,t}  >=  0, the capacity of technology g whose construction starts in year t; u_{g,t}  >=  0, the capacity of technology g commissioned and becoming available in year t; K_{g,t}  >=  0, the available capacity of technology g in year t; p_{g,t}  >=  0, the energy produced by technology g in year t; r_{g,t}  >=  0, the capacity of technology g retired in year t; w_{k,t}  in  {0,1}, the activation of nuclear procurement tranche k in year t (activation is persistent thereafter); b_t  >=  0, new debt issuance in year t linked to financed capital expenditures; and DS_t  >=  0, debt service in year t. The objective is to minimize the net present cost over the horizon, equal to the sum across years of the discount factor times the sum, over all technologies, of capital cost applied to construction starts plus fixed O&M on available capacity plus variable O&M and fuel costs on dispatched energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints in every year. Energy balance: total generation across all technologies must meet or exceed annual energy demand. Production limits: each technology’s annual generation is bounded by its capacity factor times 8,760 hours times its available capacity. Capacity adequacy: the sum of availability-adjusted capacity across technologies must meet peak demand with the required reserve margin. Nuclear share ceiling: the total nuclear capacity cannot exceed the stated fraction of total capacity. Construction lag and commissioning: commissioning in a given year for a technology equals the construction starts from the year offset by that technology’s construction lag; if the lagged index falls before the start of the horizon, commissioning is zero. Capacity accounting with lifetimes: available capacity equals the baseline legacy capacity plus the cumulative commissioned capacity that remains within its economic lifetime up to that year, minus retirements in that year. Legacy oil fleet is fixed: oil capacity equals the given fixed value in all years, with no new oil builds or retirements permitted. Permitting windows: construction starts for any technology in any year are zero unless permits allow that start; when permitted, starts are upper-bounded by a large constant to avoid artificial limits. Nuclear tranche limits: total nuclear commissioning in a year is limited by the sum of the capacity caps of all activated tranches in that year. Tranche persistence: each tranche’s activation is non-decreasing over time, so once activated it remains active thereafter. Annual build ramp rate: for each technology, the year-over-year increase in construction starts cannot exceed its maximum ramp. Financing constraints: debt issuance in each year equals the financed fraction of capital expenditures on that year’s construction starts; debt service in each year must be at least the interest on cumulative debt scaled by the amortization factor and must not exceed the annual debt service exposure cap.\n",

For each commodity k, a finite set P_k of segment-routing (SR)–valid candidate paths is given; each path p has known latency L[p], traverses links according to the incidence A[e,p], and exits the network at egress interface(s) indicated by B[g,p]. Each link e has capacity Cap[e], a target utilization fraction alpha[e], reserved resilience headroom H[e], and a tariff c[e] per unit traffic; each egress interface g has a rate limit R_max[g].

Each commodity’s multipath fan-out is capped by M[k].

Each guest i has recorded height H[i]; each ski pair j has length L[j]. Compatibility and policy feasibility are provided by binary parameters compat[i,j] and policy[i,j]; physical availability is given by avail[j]. Priority group k has a minimum service target target[k]. A prior plan is represented by prev[i,j] indicating whether guest i previously held pair j. Weights  alpha ,  beta ,  gamma , and  delta [k] tune the importance of fit quality, reassignment penalties, unserved penalties, and priority shortfalls, respectively, and M is a sufficiently large constant for linearizing absolute values. Decision variables are: x[i,j]  in  {0,1} indicating whether guest i is assigned pair j; u[i]  in  {0,1} indicating whether guest i is unserved; ch[i]  in  {0,1} indicating whether guest i’s prior assignment is broken (reassigned or unassigned relative to prev); d[i]  >=  0 representing the realized absolute height–length gap for guest i; and slack[k]  >=  0 representing shortfall against the minimum service target for group k.\n",

There are three refrigerated trailers K = {1,2,3}, each trailer k has a maximum allowable weight CapW_k, a maximum allowable volume/pallet capacity CapV_k, a hazmat certification flag A_k  in  {0,1}, a fixed non‑handling time overhead  tau _k, and a maximum allowable dock time window Tmax_k.

Hazmat certification: a hazmat order (h_i = 1) may be assigned only to a hazmat‑certified trailer, so assignment to any non‑certified trailer is prohibited.

Peak payload definition: to represent the maximum trailer weight, each trailer’s weight W_k must be no greater than M. Oversize restriction: each trailer may carry at most one oversized order, so the sum of oversized indicators among orders assigned to a given trailer is at most one. Incompatibility pairs: for every incompatible pair (i, j) and each trailer k, the two orders cannot be co‑loaded on the same trailer, so their assignment indicators on that trailer cannot both be one.

Decision variables include: y[f]  in  {0,1} indicating whether facility f is active; g[f]  in  {0,1} indicating whether facility f is newly built (greenfield); c[f]  in  {0,1} indicating whether facility f has an active temperature-controlled retrofit; x[s,f]  in  {0,1} assigning store s to the primary service territory of facility f; z[l]  in  {0,1} indicating whether 3PL lane l is activated; q[p,f,s,t]  >=  0 units shipped from facility f to store s for product p in period t; w[p,l,s,t]  >=  0 units shipped via 3PL lane l to store s for product p in period t; v[p,r,f,t]  >=  0 inbound units of product p from port r to facility f in period t; inv[p,f,t]  >=  0 end-of-period inventory of product p at facility f in period t; e[f]  >=  0 incremental throughput capacity added at facility f (units per period); and u[f,t]  >=  0 slack for throughput above a defined threshold at facility f in period t. The objective is to minimize total landed cost across the planning horizon: fixed operating costs for active facilities (overhead, maintenance, depreciation), capital expenditures for greenfield builds and capacity expansions, inbound and outbound transportation costs, 3PL lane costs, labor costs driven by pick-path times, inventory holding costs, and a risk penalty proportional to the utilization slack u[f,t].\n",
      "\n",
      "The network must satisfy the following constraints. Demand fulfillment: for every product, store, and period, the sum of units shipped from all facilities plus the sum shipped via all 3PL lanes equals the forecast demand. Facility activation links flows: a closed facility cannot ship, i.e., any shipment from facility f to a store is bounded by demand and requires y[f] = 1. Outbound throughput capacity: for each facility and period, total outbound units shipped across all products and stores cannot exceed the baseline throughput plus any expansion e[f], and is zero if the facility is inactive. Labor feasibility: for each facility and period, total pick-path time (sum over products and stores of average pick time times units shipped) cannot exceed available labor hours. Slotting capacity: for each facility and period, the slot-equivalent total of end-of-period inventory cannot exceed the facility’s slotting capacity when active. Inventory balance: at each facility, product, and period, end inventory equals prior inventory plus total inbound from ports minus total outbound to stores, using the given initial inventories at the horizon start. Port throughput capacity: for each port and period, total inbound units routed through the port to all facilities cannot exceed the port’s capacity. 3PL lane capacity and activation: for each lane and period, total units shipped via the lane cannot exceed its capacity, and shipment is permitted only if the lane is activated. Service-level feasibility: shipments are allowed only on arcs that meet lead-time service levels, i.e., facility-to-store and 3PL lane-to-store flows are each bounded by demand times the corresponding admissibility indicator. Temperature-controlled capacity: for each facility and period, outbound units of temperature-controlled products cannot exceed the facility’s temperature-controlled capacity when a retrofit is active, and a retrofit can only be active at an active facility. Capex budget: total capital spend on greenfield activations and throughput expansions cannot exceed the capex budget. Territory assignment consistency: each store is assigned to exactly one primary facility, and shipments from a facility to a store are bounded by demand and permitted only if that facility is the store’s assigned territory. Utilization risk slack: for each facility and period, total outbound units cannot exceed the utilization threshold when active, but any excess is captured by nonnegative slack u[f,t], which is penalized in the objective.\n",
      "Objective: Minimize total landed cost over the planning horizon, including: facility fixed costs, depreciation, maintenance and overhead; capital expenditures for greenfield builds and capacity expansions; inbound and outbound transportation costs; 3PL lane costs; labor costs driven by pick-path time; inventory holding costs; plus a risk penalty on throughput utilization exceeding thresholds.\n",
      "Expected Output: An optimal or near-optimal network design including: which facilities to open, expand, retrofit for temperature control, or retire; store-to-DC territory assignments; inbound port-to-DC allocations; outbound volumes by DC-to-store and 3PL lane by period; capacity utilization, labor hours used, and slotting utilization by facility; total landed cost broken down by cost category; risk/penalty metrics; and a ranked shortlist of configurations that meet cost-to-serve and service targets.\n",

      "Title: Quarter-Window Buy–Sell and Truck Slot Scheduling for Cooking Oil Wholesale\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a wholesaler planning over a finite set of discrete periods t in a quarter, with zero beginning inventory and a requirement to clear all inventory at quarter end. Parameters are: inbound lead time L_in (periods from purchase order to usable receipt), warehouse capacity W_cap, inbound and outbound truck capacities Cap_in and Cap_out, period-specific slot limits S_in_t and S_out_t for inbound and outbound trucks, demand forecasts D_t, unit purchase price c, period carrying cost rate h_t per unit held from t−1 to t, fixed truck costs F_in and F_out, a piecewise-linear selling price curve in each period with segments k having width limits seg_width_{t,k} and unit prices price_{t,k}, a per-period cap K_max_t on the number of active price segments, a per-unit penalty p_u for unmet demand, and initial cash Cash_init. Decisions each period are: q_in_t  >=  0 (quantity ordered; arrives after L_in periods), q_out_t  >=  0 (quantity released/sold), I_t  >=  0 (end-of-period inventory), x_in_t and x_out_t (nonnegative integers for inbound and outbound trucks booked), z_{t,k}  >=  0 (quantity sold in price segment k), y_{t,k}  in  {0,1} (activation of price segment k), u_t  >=  0 (unmet demand), and Cash_t (end-of-period cash, constrained to be nonnegative). The objective is to maximize total gross margin over the quarter: the sum over all periods of selling revenue minus purchase costs, inventory carrying costs, logistics costs, and penalties for unmet demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is constrained as follows. Inventory evolves with inbound lead time: for each period t, I_t equals I_{t−1} plus the arrivals from orders placed L_in periods earlier minus current releases, that is, I_t = I_{t−1} + q_in_{t−L_in} − q_out_t, with I_0 = 0 and q_in_{t−L_in} defined as zero whenever t  <=  L_in; warehouse capacity bounds inventory each period, 0  <=  I_t  <=  W_cap; truck capacities link flows to bookings, q_in_t  <=  Cap_in x_in_t and q_out_t  <=  Cap_out x_out_t; truck slot availability limits bookings, x_in_t  <=  S_in_t and x_out_t  <=  S_out_t; demand is balanced by sales and optional lost sales, q_out_t + u_t = D_t for all t; and quarter-end clearance requires I_t = 0 in the final period. Selling revenue is modeled by a piecewise-linear structure: in each period t, q_out_t =  sum _k z_{t,k}, with 0  <=  z_{t,k}  <=  seg_width_{t,k} y_{t,k} and  sum _k y_{t,k}  <=  K_max_t; revenue in period t is Rev_t =  sum _k price_{t,k} z_{t,k}. Cash feasibility is enforced by a period-by-period recursion with nonnegativity: Cash_t = Cash_{t−1} + Rev_t − PurchCost_t − CarryCost_t − LogCost_t − Penalty_t, Cash_t  >=  0 for all t, and Cash_0 = Cash_init, where PurchCost_t = c q_in_t, CarryCost_t = h_t I_{t−1}, LogCost_t = F_in x_in_t + F_out x_out_t, and Penalty_t = p_u u_t.\n",
      "Objective: Maximize total gross margin over the quarter: sum of selling revenues (from price curves) minus purchase costs, carrying costs, and logistics costs, minus penalties for unmet demand, subject to warehouse capacity, truck slot, cash-flow feasibility, and rotation constraints.\n",
      "Expected Output: Period-by-period inbound purchase quantities, outbound release quantities, truck bookings (inbound and outbound), inventory levels, cash balances, unmet demand amounts if any, and the total gross margin achieved over the quarter.\n",

      "Formal Problem Statement: Calibrate an infusion pump’s flow sensor using a single linear model f̂(s) =  alpha  +  beta  s based on N paired observations of reference flows r_i (mL/h) and raw sensor outputs s_i, with nonnegative weights w_i. The decision variables are:  alpha , the intercept (mL/h), and  beta , the slope (mL/h per sensor unit); both are implemented in firmware fixed-point form via integers A_int and B_int such that  alpha  = q_a A_int and  beta  = q_b B_int, with A_int and B_int restricted to integers. For each observation i = 1, ... ,N, include a nonnegative variable e_i representing the absolute deviation |r_i − ( alpha  +  beta  s_i)|. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of absolute deviations ∑_{i=1}^N w_i e_i.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impose the following constraints. Absolute deviation linearization for all i: e_i  >=  r_i − ( alpha  +  beta  s_i), e_i  >=  −(r_i − ( alpha  +  beta  s_i)), and e_i  >=  0, ensuring e_i equals the absolute error. Firmware quantization:  alpha  = q_a A_int and  beta  = q_b B_int with A_int and B_int integers. Physical plausibility bounds:  alpha _min  <=   alpha   <=   alpha _max and  beta _min  <=   beta   <=   beta _max, with  beta _min  >=  0 to enforce monotonicity of the calibration. Regulatory dose-accuracy at critical points: for every i in the critical subset C, the absolute error must not exceed T_abs, enforced by r_i − ( alpha  +  beta  s_i)  <=  T_abs and −(r_i − ( alpha  +  beta  s_i))  <=  T_abs. Range fairness: for each operating range k with index set B_k, the cumulative absolute deviation is limited by ∑_{i in B_k} e_i  <=  Γ_k. Calibration stability across the full dataset: cap the worst-case absolute deviation by e_i  <=  E_max for all i. The solution returns quantized  alpha  and  beta  (and their integers A_int and B_int), per-observation deviations e_i, and the optimal objective value, satisfying all constraints for regulatory compliance and firmware deployment.\n",

      "Title: Humanitarian Airlift Load Planning with Fuel Trade-offs and Center-of-Gravity Control\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: Problem: Plan the cargo manifest and fuel load for a single humanitarian flight into a short, rough airstrip. A set I of candidate items is available, each with mass m_i, volume v_i, a prescribed longitudinal arm for moment calculation arm_i, a clinical utility score u_i, and attributes indicating whether it requires cold-chain (subset I_cold), whether it is hazmat-incompatible with certain other items (unordered pairs H_incompat  subset of  I  times  I), donor linkage (each donor d  in  D has a subset D_items(d)  subset of  I and a minimum item commitment q_d), and the site or priority it serves (subsets I_s  subset of  I for s  in  S with minimum utility thresholds U_s_min). The aircraft is partitioned into loading zones Z with per-zone mass capacity W_z_max and volume capacity V_z_max; certain zones are cold-capable Z_cold  subset of  Z with cold-zone volume capacities V_z_cold_max. Aircraft parameters include empty weight W_empty located at arm_empty, fuel tanks located at arm_fuel, certified maximum takeoff weight MTOW, certified maximum zero-fuel weight ZFW_max, an allowable center-of-gravity envelope [CG_min, CG_max], operational fuel bounds [F_min, F_max], and a weather/runway-dependent allowable takeoff weight TOW_runway_max. Decision variables are: x_i  in  {0,1} indicating whether item i is loaded; y_{i,z}  in  {0,1} indicating whether item i is placed in zone z; F  >=  0 the fuel mass (continuous); and auxiliary continuous variables W_load (total loaded cargo mass), ZFW (zero-fuel weight), TOW (takeoff weight), and M (total longitudinal moment; the implied CG must lie within the envelope via moment bounds).\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective: Maximize the total delivered clinical utility minus a penalty on fuel mass, i.e., maximize  sum _{i in I} u_i x_i − c_f F, subject to the following constraints. Assignment linking (no split loads): each item, if and only if loaded, must be assigned to exactly one zone, i.e., for every i, the sum of y_{i,z} over all zones z equals x_i. Zone mass capacity: for every zone z, the total mass assigned there,  sum _i m_i y_{i,z}, does not exceed W_z_max. Zone volume capacity: for every zone z, the total volume assigned there,  sum _i v_i y_{i,z}, does not exceed V_z_max. Payload mass definition: the total loaded cargo mass satisfies W_load =  sum _i m_i x_i. Zero-fuel weight: ZFW = W_empty + W_load and ZFW  <=  ZFW_max. Takeoff weight: TOW = W_empty + W_load + F. Weight limits: TOW  <=  MTOW and TOW  <=  TOW_runway_max. Aircraft longitudinal moment: M equals the sum of the empty-weight moment, fuel moment, and item moments, i.e., M = W_empty * arm_empty + F * arm_fuel +  sum _i (m_i * arm_i * x_i). Center-of-gravity envelope: the moment must lie within the linear bounds induced by the CG limits, CG_min * TOW  <=  M  <=  CG_max * TOW. Cold-chain placement: every item requiring cold-chain must be placed only in cold-capable zones, i.e., for each i  in  I_cold, the sum of y_{i,z} over z  in  Z_cold equals x_i. Cold-zone capacity: for each cold-capable zone z  in  Z_cold, the total volume assigned there,  sum _i v_i y_{i,z}, does not exceed V_z_cold_max. Hazmat incompatibility segregation: for every incompatible pair (i, j)  in  H_incompat and every zone z, at most one of the two may be placed in that zone, i.e., y_{i,z} + y_{j,z}  <=  1. Donor obligations: for every donor d  in  D, at least q_d linked items are loaded, i.e.,  sum _{i in D_items(d)} x_i  >=  q_d. Site-priority utility floors: for every site or priority s  in  S, the total utility of loaded items serving s meets its minimum, i.e.,  sum _{i in I_s} u_i x_i  >=  U_s_min. Fuel bounds: the chosen fuel mass respects operational limits, F_min  <=  F  <=  F_max. The optimal solution specifies which items are loaded and where they are stowed, the fuel mass, and the resulting weights and moment, while satisfying all safety, capacity, segregation, and obligation requirements.\n",

      "Title: Nationwide Beverage Network Flow, Mode, and Carrier Allocation under Freshness and Capacity Constraints\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: We consider a nationwide, multi-period production and distribution planning problem for beverages across a set of plants and co-packers, regional distribution centers (RDCs), SKUs, months, and transportation modes (truckload TL, less-than-truckload LTL, intermodal IM), with carrier choices on each lane. The decision variables are: z[p,m,tau]  >=  0, the pallets of SKU m produced at plant/co-packer p in production month tau; x[p,r,m,tau,t,k]  >=  0, the pallets of SKU m shipped from p to RDC r, produced in tau and arriving in month t via mode k; a[r,m,t]  >=  0, the pallets of demand served for SKU m at RDC r in month t; s[r,m,t]  >=  0, end-of-month inventory of SKU m at RDC r; o[p,tau]  >=  0, overtime capacity used at plant p in month tau; nTL[p,r,tau,t]  in  Z+, the number of TL dispatches from p to r for shipments produced in tau and arriving in t; v[c,p,r,m,tau,t,k]  >=  0, the pallets of SKU m allocated to carrier c on lane (p to r, mode k) for shipments produced in tau and arriving in t; and y[p,r,m]  in  {0,1}, which authorizes plant p to serve RDC r for SKU m. The objective is to minimize total monthly cost: production cost plus overtime cost, transportation cost (mode-specific rates incorporating distance and period fuel surcharges), fixed TL dispatch costs, and inventory holding costs at RDCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan must satisfy the following constraints. Inventory at each RDC and month balances: ending inventory equals prior inventory plus arriving shipments whose arrival month t equals production month tau plus the lane’s lead time, minus demand served; initial inventory is given. Demand served for each RDC, SKU, and month is bounded between zero and the forecast. Regional fill-rate SLAs are met: total served volume across all SKUs and months in a region is at least the required fraction of total demand. Safety stock is maintained at each RDC and month. Production-to-shipment linkage holds: total shipments of a SKU produced at a plant in a month cannot exceed that month’s production of the SKU at that plant. Plant capacity limits apply with overtime: the sum of production converted to hours by SKU-specific rates cannot exceed regular hours plus used overtime, and overtime is bounded by its monthly maximum. RDC dock calendars cap receipts: total pallets arriving to each RDC in a month cannot exceed its dock capacity. TL shipments are discretized: TL pallets on a lane for a given (production month, arrival month) pair cannot exceed TLsize times the integer number of TL dispatches. Carrier allocation is conserved: for every lane-SKU-flow, the sum of pallets assigned to eligible carriers equals the lane-level pallets shipped; and each carrier’s monthly allocation on a lane meets its minimum commitment and does not exceed its maximum capacity, aggregating across SKUs and all production months that arrive in that month. Freshness is enforced: shipments are permitted only when their age (arrival minus production month) does not exceed the SKU’s freshness window and the arrival month equals production month plus mode-specific lead time; otherwise the shipment volume is forced to zero via gating. Facility-to-market assignments gate flows: shipments for an RDC-SKU from a plant are allowed only if the assignment variable is active. Finally, to limit complexity and enforce consolidation, the number of plants authorized to serve each RDC-SKU is capped by a specified maximum.\n",

      "Title: Monthly Build Plan: Profit-Maximizing Product Mix with Material and Capacity Constraints\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: A mid-sized sports equipment manufacturer must decide a monthly build plan across a set of products P and plants S, subject to constrained materials M with supplier sets V_m. The decision variables are: x_{p,s}  >=  0, the production quantity of product p at plant s; y_{p,s}  in  {0,1}, a setup/changeover indicator equal to 1 if product p is produced at plant s (incurring setup time and cost); q_{m,v}  >=  0, the quantity of material m ordered from supplier v that is deliverable within the month; z_{m,v}  in  {0,1}, a binary order trigger for material m from supplier v to enforce minimum order quantities; and OT_s  >=  0, overtime hours planned at plant s. The objective is to maximize monthly profit: total sales revenue (price_p times x_{p,s} over all products and plants) minus non-material variable manufacturing costs (vc_p times x_{p,s}), minus material procurement expenditures (procurement_cost_{m,v} times q_{m,v}), minus overtime costs (overtime_rate_s times OT_s), minus changeover costs (changeover_cost_{p,s} times y_{p,s}).\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is constrained as follows. Demand caps: for each product p, total production across all plants must not exceed its marketing demand cap D_p. Material availability with scrap: for each material m, total BOM consumption across all products and plants, inflated by the scrap factor (bom_{p,m} times (1 + scrap_m) times x_{p,s}), must not exceed on-hand inventory OnHand_m plus the portion of purchased material deliverable within the month (avail_{m,v} times q_{m,v} summed over suppliers v in V_m). Supplier allocations: for each material-supplier pair (m, v), the purchased quantity q_{m,v} must not exceed the supplier’s allocation cap Alloc_{m,v}. MOQ linking: for each (m, v), enforce minimum-order logic by requiring q_{m,v}  >=  MOQ_{m,v} z_{m,v} and q_{m,v}  <=  U_{m,v} z_{m,v}. Plant capacity with setups and overtime: for each plant s, the sum of processing time over all scheduled production (t_{p,s} times x_{p,s}) plus setup time per active product (setup_time_s times the number of products with y_{p,s} = 1) must not exceed regular-time capacity plus overtime (CapReg_s + OT_s). Overtime bounds: for each plant s, overtime must lie between zero and the allowable maximum, 0  <=  OT_s  <=  CapOT_s. Production–setup linking and minimum batch sizes: for each product-plant pair (p, s), if a product is produced then its quantity must respect x_{p,s}  <=  M_{p,s} y_{p,s} and x_{p,s}  >=  MinBatch_{p,s} y_{p,s}. Manufacturing feasibility by site: production setups are permitted only where the site is process-capable, y_{p,s}  <=  Feasible_{p,s}. Nonnegativity and integrality: x_{p,s}, q_{m,v}, and OT_s are nonnegative; y_{p,s} and z_{m,v} are binary.\n",
      "Objective: Maximize monthly profit: sum_{p in P, s in S} price_p * x_{p,s} - sum_{p in P, s in S} vc_p * x_{p,s} - sum_{m in M, v in V_m} procurement_cost_{m,v} * q_{m,v} - sum_{s in S} overtime_rate_s * OT_s - sum_{p in P, s in S} changeover_cost_{p,s} * y_{p,s}.\n",
      "Expected Output: Optimal production quantities x_{p,s} by product and plant, setup decisions y_{p,s}, material purchase quantities q_{m,v} by supplier, overtime plan OT_s, and the maximum profit value. The solution should also report binding constraints (e.g., which materials or plants are capacity-constrained), expected material consumption by BOM, and feasibility flags for products not scheduled due to constraints.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me structure the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Model Overview**: This is a multi-product production and sales planning model using PuLP. It maximizes the profit from sales while considering inventory, machine capacity, and warehouse constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Variables**:\n",
      "   - `x[p,t]`: Production quantity of product `p` in period `t`\n",
      "   - `I[p,t]`: Inventory of product `p` at end of period `t`\n",
      "   - `s[p,t]`: Sales quantity of product `p` in period `t`\n",
      "   - `h[p,m,t]`: Machine hours used for product `p` on machine `m` in period `t`\n",
      "   - `z[p,t]`: Binary variable indicating if product `p` is produced in period `t`\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Constraints**:\n",
      "   - **Inventory Balance**: Inventory at time `t` depends on previous inventory, production, and sales.\n",
      "   - **Sales Limits**: Sales must be between minimum (`L`) and maximum (`D`) values.\n",
      "   - **Storage Capacity**: Each product has a max inventory level (`Cap`).\n",
      "   - **Warehouse Capacity**: Total inventory space (weighted by product) must not exceed warehouse capacity per period.\n",
      "   - **Minimum Stock**: End-of-period inventory must meet target (`R`).\n",
      "   - **Production-Setup Link**: Production is only possible if a setup is done (via `z`).\n",
      "   - **Machine Capacity**: Total machine hours used per machine and period must not exceed available hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Objective**: Maximize profit = (sales revenue - holding costs) - setup costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Why Binary Variables?**: To model \"if a product is produced in a period, then a setup is needed\". This avoids the need for multiple machines to be set up for the same product.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Real-World Relevance**: This model is useful for companies that have limited machine time and need to plan production without overstocking, especially when setups are costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential pitfalls to mention:\n",
      "- The model assumes all products are produced in a single period (if `z` is 1), but in reality, setups might be more complex.\n",
      "- The warehouse capacity is a linear constraint but might need to account for perishable goods.\n",
      "- The machine hours are calculated as a function of production and setup, which might not capture all real-world factors like machine downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user might need to know how to adjust this model for their specific problem, like adding more products, changing time periods, or adjusting constraints.\n",

      "Title: Cryptarithmetic Addition with Explicit Carries\n",
      "Formal Problem Statement: Given three input words A, B, and C over uppercase letters that are to satisfy the base-10 addition A + B = C, assign a distinct decimal digit to each letter. Let L be the set of distinct letters appearing in A, B, and C. The decision variables are: x[l]  in  {0,1, ... ,9} for each l  in  L, denoting the digit assigned to letter l; carry variables c[k]  in  {0,1} for k = 0, ... ,K, where K = max(|A|,|B|,|C|), c[0] is fixed to 0, and c[K] is the final outgoing carry; numeric values V_A, V_B, and V_C representing the base-10 numbers encoded by A, B, and C; and auxiliary per-column digit variables dA[k], dB[k], dC[k] for k = 0, ... ,K−1 defined by right-aligned indexing with k = 0 as the least significant position: dA[k] equals x[the letter at column k of A] if present, otherwise 0; similarly for dB[k] and dC[k]. The positional weight at column k is 10^k, so V_A =  sum _{k=0}^{|A|−1} dA[k] * 10^k, V_B =  sum _{k=0}^{|B|−1} dB[k] * 10^k, and V_C =  sum _{k=0}^{|C|−1} dC[k] * 10^k.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective is lexicographic: first minimize the total number of carries  sum _{k=1}^{K} c[k]; subject to that minimum, maximize the numeric value V_C. The constraints are: distinct letters take distinct digits (AllDifferent over {x[l] : l  in  L}); the leading letters of A, B, and C (their leftmost characters) are nonzero, i.e., x[head(A)]  !=  0, x[head(B)]  !=  0, and x[head(C)]  !=  0; column-wise addition with explicit carries holds for every column k = 0, ... ,K−1, namely dA[k] + dB[k] + c[k] = dC[k] + 10 * c[k+1]; carry bounds are respected with c[k]  in  {0,1} and c[0] = 0; digit domains are x[l]  in  {0, ... ,9} for all l; the value linkage definitions of V_A, V_B, and V_C are as above; and the global sum consistency holds, V_A + V_B = V_C.\n",
