  "---\nTitle:    Balanced Incomplete Block Designs\nProposer: Steven Prestwich\nCategory:\n    - Design and configuration\n    - Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\nBalanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) generation is a standard combinatorial problem from design theory, originally used in the design of statistical experiments but since finding other applications such as cryptography. It is a special case of Block Design, which also includes Latin Square problems.\n\nBIBD generation is described in most standard textbooks on combinatorics. A BIBD is defined as an arrangement of $v$ distinct objects into $b$ blocks such that each block contains exactly $k$ distinct objects, each object occurs in exactly $r$ different blocks, and every two distinct objects occur together in exactly $\\lambda$ blocks. Another way of defining a BIBD is in terms of its incidence matrix, which is a $v$ by $b$ binary matrix with exactly $r$ ones per row, $k$ ones per column, and with a scalar product\nof $\\lambda$ between any pair of distinct rows. A BIBD is therefore specified by its parameters $(v,b,r,k,\\lambda)$. An example of a solution for $(7,7,3,3,1)$ is:\n\n    0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n    1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n    0 0 1 1 0 0 1\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n    0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n    1 0 0 1 0 1 0\n    0 1 0 1 1 0 0 \n\nLam's problem {prob025} is that of finding a BIBD with parameters $(111,111,11,11,1)$.",
  "---\nTitle:    Magic Squares and Sequences\nProposer: Toby Walsh\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\n\nAn order $n$ magic square is a $n$ by $n$ matrix containing the numbers $1$\nto $n^2$, with each row, column and main diagonal equal the same\nsum. As well as finding magic squares, we are interested in the number\nof a given size that exist.  There are several interesting\nvariations. For example, we may insist on certain values in certain\nsquares (like in quasigroup completion) and ask if the magic square\ncan be completed. In a heterosquare, each row, column and diagonal\nsums to a different value. In an anti-magic square, the row, column\nand diagonal sums form a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\nA magic sequence of length $n$ is a sequence of integers $x_0 \\ldots\nx_{n-1}$ between $0$ and $n-1$, such that for all $i$ in $0$ to $n-1$,\nthe number $i$ occurs exactly $x_i$ times in the sequence. For instance,\n$6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0$ is a magic sequence since $0$ occurs $6$ times\nin it, $1$ occurs twice, etc.",

The curriculum must obey the following administrative and academic regulations: \n\n* Academic curriculum: an academic curriculum is defined by a set of courses and a set of prerequisite relationships among them. \n* Number of periods: courses must be assigned within a maximum number of academic periods. \n* Academic load: each course has associated a number of credits or units that represent the academic effort required to successfully follow it. \n* Prerequisites: some courses can have other courses as prerequisites. \n* Minimum academic load: a minimum number of academic credits per period is required to consider a student as full time. \n* Maximum academic load: a maximum number of academic credits per period is allowed in order to avoid overload. \n* Minimum number of courses: a minimum number of courses per period is required to consider a student as full time. \n* Maximum number of courses: a maximum number of courses per period is allowed in order to avoid overload. \n\nThe goal is to assign a period to every course in a way that the minimum and maximum academic load for each period, the minimum and maximum number of courses for each period, and the prerequisite relationships are satisfied. An optimal balanced curriculum minimises the maximum academic load for all periods.\n\nNote that we could consider other types of balance criterion, such as minimising an expression on the deviation from the mean load per period. This is explored in Monette et al\n\n\n**The Generalised Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem**\n\nMarco Chiarandini, Luca Di Gaspero, Stefano Gualandi, and Andrea Schaerf have proposed a more challenging <a href=\"http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob064\">generalised version</a> of the problem.",

So the $n$-queens problem is to find a set of $n$ locations on a chessboard, no two of which are on the same row, column or diagonal.  \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"assets/4queens.png\" alt=\"solution to 4-queens\">\n  <figcaption>A solution to 4-queens</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\nA simple arithmetical observation may be helpful in understanding models. Suppose a queen is represented by an ordered pair (\u03b1,\u03b2), the value \u03b1 represents the queen\u2019s column, and \u03b2 its row on the chessboard. Then two queens do not attack each other iff they have different values of *all* of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1-\u03b2, and \u03b1+\u03b2. It may not be intuitively obvious that chessboard diagonals correspond to sums and differences, but consider moving one square along the two orthogonal diagonals: in one direction the sum of the coordinates does not change, while in the other direction the difference does not change. (We do not suggest that pairs (\u03b1,\u03b2) is a good representation for solving.) \n\nThe problem has inherent symmetry. That is, for any solution we obtain another solution by any of the 8 symmetries of the chessboard (including the identity) obtained by combinations of rotations by 90 degrees and reflections. \n\nThe problem is extremely well studied in the mathematical literature. An outstanding survey from 2009 is by Bell & Stevens cite{Bell20091}.\n\nSee below for discussions of complexity problems with $n$-Queens. For closely related variants without these problems see {prob079}, [prob079], and {prob080}, [prob080].\n\nComplexity\n==========\n\nSome care has to be taken when using the $n$-queens problem as a benchmark.  Here are some points to bear in mind:\n\n* The $n$-queens problem is solvable for $n=1$ and $n \\geq 4$. So the decision problem is solvable in constant time. \n* A solution to the $n$-queens problem for any $n \\not = 2,3$ was given in 1874 by Pauls and can be found in Bell & Stevens' survey  cite{Bell20091}. It can be constructed in time $O(n)$ (assuming arithemetical operations on size $n$ are $O(1)$.) \n* Note that the parameter $n$ for $n$-queens only needs $\\log(n)$ bits to specify, so actually $O(n)$ is exponential in the input size. I.e. it's not trivial to provide a witness of poly size in the input. \n* While the decision problem is easy, counting the number of solutions for given $n$ is not. Indeed Bell & Stevens cite{Bell20091} report that there is no closed form expression for it and that it is \"beyond #P-Complete\", citing cite{Hsiang200487}. (Oddly cite{chaiken-queens} report a closed form solution for the number of solutions to $n$-queens: it's unclear if this contradicts the earlier result, but more importantly it's not clear that this has better complexity than simply enumerating solutions.)",
  "---\nTitle:    All-Interval Series\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\nProposer: Holger Hoos\n---\n\nGiven the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c#, d, ...), represented by numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a pair of neighbouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this interval appears. \n\nThe problem of finding such a series can be easily formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on $\\mathbb Z_n$, the set of integer residues modulo $n$.

  "---\nTitle:    Vessel Loading\nProposer: Ken Brown\nCategory: Design and configuration\n---\n\n\n\nSupply vessels transport containers from site to site. The deck area is rectangular. Containers are cuboid, and are laid out in a single layer. All containers are positioned parallel to the sides of the deck. The contents of the containers determine their class. Certain classes of containers are constrained to be separated by minimum distances either along the deck or across the deck. `\n\nThe vessel loading decision problem is to determine whether a given set of containers can be positioned on a given deck, without overlapping, and without violating any of the separation constraints. The problem can be modelled as packing of a set of rectangles into a larger rectangle, subject to constraints.\n\nIn practice, the layout may be further constrained by the physical loading sequence. Containers are manoeuvred into position from the south east corner. Each successive container in the loading sequence must be positioned so that it touches part of another container or a deck wall both to the north and to the west.",
  "---\nTitle:    Template Design\nProposer: Barbara Smith \nCategory: \n    - Bin packing\n    - Partitioning and related problems\n---\n\n\nThis problem arises from a colour printing firm which produces a variety of products from thin board, including cartons for human and animal food and magazine inserts. Food products, for example, are often marketed as a basic brand with several variations (typically flavours). Packaging for such variations usually has the same overall design, in particular the same size and shape, but differs in a small proportion of the text displayed and/or in colour. For instance, two variations of a cat food carton may differ only in that on one is printed 'Chicken Flavour' on a blue background whereas the other has 'Rabbit Flavour' printed on a green background. A typical order is for a variety of quantities of several design variations. Because each variation is identical in dimension, we know in advance exactly how many items can be printed on each mother sheet of board, whose dimensions are largely determined by the dimensions of the printing machinery. Each mother sheet is printed from a template, consisting of a thin aluminium sheet on which the design for several of the variations is etched. The problem is to decide, firstly, how many distinct templates to produce, and secondly, which variations, and how many copies of each, to include on each template.\nThe following example is based on data from an order for cartons for different varieties of dry cat-food.\n\nVariation \t|\t Order Quantity\n-------  \t|   --------------\nLiver\t \t|\t 250,000\nRabbit\t \t|\t 255,000\nTuna\t \t|\t 260,000\nChicken Twin|\t 500,000\nPilchard Twin|\t 500,000\nChicken\t\t|\t 800,000\nPilchard\t|  1,100,000\nTotal\t    |  3,665,000\n\n\nEach design of carton is made from an identically sized and shaped piece of board. Nine cartons can be printed on each mother sheet, and several different designs can be printed at once, on the same mother sheet. (Hence, at least 407,223 sheets of card will be required to satisfy these order quantities.)\nBecause in this example there are more slots in each template (9) than there are variations (7), it would be possible to fulfil the order using just one template. This creates an enormous amount of waste card, however. We can reduce the amount of waste by using more templates; with three templates, the amount of waste produced is negligible. The problem is therefore to produce template plans which will minimize the amount of waste produced, for 1 template, 2 templates,... and so on.\n\nIt is permissible to work in units of say 1000 cartons, so that the order quantities become 250, 255, etc.\n\nA variant is to allow up to 10% under-production of some designs, if this allows the overall over-production to be reduced. This is not a sensible option for the catfood problem, because it leads to under-production of all the designs.\n\nThe optimal solutions for the catfood problem are shown below. For each template, the table gives a list of the number of slots allocated to each design, e.g. [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,] means that 1 slot is allocated to each of the first five designs and two each to the last two.\n\nNo. of\ttemplates   | Layouts\tof each template\t    | No. of Pressings\t| Total pressings\n---------- | -------------- | ----------------  |\n1\t\t   | [1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\t| 550,000\t| 550,000\n2\t\t   | [0,0,0,0,0,2,7]\t| 158,000\t|\n    \t   | [1,1,1,2,2,2,0]\t| 260,000\t| 418,000\n3\t\t   | [0,5,3,0,0,1,0]\t| 51,000\t|\n    \t   | [0,0,1,0,0,7,1]\t| 107,000\t|\n    \t   | [1,0,0,2,2,0,4]\t| 250,000\t| 408,000",

Suppose a queen is represented by an ordered pair (\u03b1,\u03b2), the value \u03b1 represents the queen\u2019s column, and \u03b2 its row on the chessboard. Then two queens do not attack each other iff they have different values of *all* of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1-\u03b2, and \u03b1+\u03b2. It may not be intuitively obvious that chessboard diagonals correspond to sums and differences, but consider moving one square along the two orthogonal diagonals: in one direction the sum of the coordinates does not change, while in the other direction the difference does not change. (We do not suggest that pairs (\u03b1,\u03b2) is a good representation for solving.) \n\nThe problem has inherent symmetry. That is, for any solution we obtain another solution by any of the 8 symmetries of the chessboard (including the identity) obtained by combinations of rotations by 90 degrees and reflections. \n\nThe problem is extremely well studied in the mathematical literature. An outstanding survey from 2009 is by Bell & Stevens cite{Bell20091}.\n\nSee below for discussions of complexity problems with $n$-Queens. For closely related variants without these problems see {prob079}, [prob079], and {prob080}, [prob080].\n\nComplexity\n==========\n\nSome care has to be taken when using the $n$-queens problem as a benchmark.  Here are some points to bear in mind:\n\n* The $n$-queens problem is solvable for $n=1$ and $n \\geq 4$. So the decision problem is solvable in constant time. \n* A solution to the $n$-queens problem for any $n \\not = 2,3$ was given in 1874 by Pauls and can be found in Bell & Stevens' survey  cite{Bell20091}. It can be constructed in time $O(n)$ (assuming arithemetical operations on size $n$ are $O(1)$.) \n* Note that the parameter $n$ for $n$-queens only needs $\\log(n)$ bits to specify, so actually $O(n)$ is exponential in the input size. I.e. it's not trivial to provide a witness of poly size in the input. \n* While the decision problem is easy, counting the number of solutions for given $n$ is not. Indeed Bell & Stevens cite{Bell20091} report that there is no closed form expression for it and that it is \"beyond #P-Complete\", citing cite{Hsiang200487}. (Oddly cite{chaiken-queens} report a closed form solution for the number of solutions to $n$-queens: it's unclear if this contradicts the earlier result, but more importantly it's not clear that this has better complexity than simply enumerating solutions.)",
  "---\nTitle:    Number Partitioning\nProposer: Daniel Diaz\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\n\nThis problem consists in finding a partition of numbers $1..N$ into two sets A and B such that:\n\n1. A and B have the same cardinality\n2. sum of numbers in $A$ = sum of numbers in $B$\n3. sum of squares of numbers in $A$ = sum of squares of numbers in $B$\n\nThere is no solution for $N < 8$.\n\nHere is an example for$ N = 8$:$ A = (1,4,6,7)$ and $B = (2,3,5,8)$\n\nThen from $N \\>= 8$, there is no solution if $N$ is not a multiple of $4$.\n\n### Generalisation\n\nMore constraints can thus be added, e.g also impose the equality on the sum of cubes, ...\n\nLet $C_k$ be the constraint about the power $k$ defined as the equality :\n\n$\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} A_i^k = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} B_i^k$\n\nCondition (a) corresponds to $k=0$. Condition (b) to $k=1$. Condition (c) to $k=2$.\n\nThis generalized problem can be seen as a conjunction of constraints $C_k$ until a power P $(C_0 /\\\\ C_1 /\\\\ ... /\\\\ C_P)$. The above problem corresponds to $P = 2$.\n\nEmpirically, I played with $P = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:\n\nThe sums of powers is known :\n\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^0 = N$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^1 = N \\* (N+1) / 2$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^2 = N \\* (N+1) \\* (2\\*N + 1) / 6$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^3 = N^2 \\* (N+1)^2 / 4$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^4 = N \\* (N+1) \\* (6\\*N^3 + 9\\*N^2 + N - 1) / 30$\n\n\nRecall in our case we need the half sums. The problem has no solution if the above sums are not even numbers. For P = 0 this implies N is a multiple of 2 (groups A and B have the same cardinality). For P = 1 (knowing N is multiple of 2 due to P = 0) then N \\* (N + 1) / 2 is even iff N is multiple of 4.\n\nHere are the first solutions computed:\n\n-   $P = 0$: first solutions found for $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...$ (obviously for every multiple of 2)\n-   $P = 1$: first solutions found for $N = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)\n-   $P = 2$: first solutions found for $N = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)\n-   $P = 3$: first solutions found for$ N = 16, 24, 32, 40 $(then for every multiple of 8 ?)\n-   $P = 4$: first solutions found for$ N = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64$ (then forevery multiple of 8 ?)\n\nFrom these tests, it seems the smallest N for which a solution exists is $2^{P+1}$. Can this be proved ?\n\nAfter that, it seems there are only solutions for N multiple of 2 (P= 0), 4 (P = 1 or 2), 8 (P = 3 or 4). Is this a constant depending on P ?\n\nAnother way to generalize this problem consists in increasing the numbers of groups (for instance consider 3 groups A, B, C).",

  "---\nTitle:    Bus Driver Scheduling\nProposer: Suniel Curtis\nCategory: Scheduling and related problems\n---\n\nBus driver scheduling can be formulated as a set paritioning problem. We propose 12 set partitioning problems derived from small bus driver scheduling problems. These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and only once: this is called a partition. Further,\nIn the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to minimise the number of shifts.\n\nThe problems come from four different bus companies: Reading (r1 to r5a), CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2), the former London Transport (t1 and t2). The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features). Note that r1 and r1a are the same problem, but have different numbers of generated shifts. Similarly with the problems: c1, c1a and r5, r5a. Problems are presented in the same format as the set partitioning examples in ORLIB. The first line gives the number of rows (pieces of work), columns (shifts) and the minimum number of columns need for a partition. Then each line after that corresponds to one column. It starts with the cost (which is always 1 in our case) then the number of rows it covers, followed by the rows it covers.",

  "---\nTitle:    Social Golfers Problem\nProposer: Warwick Harvey\nCategory: Scheduling and related problems\n---\n\n\nThe coordinator of a local golf club has come to you with the following problem. In their club, there are 32 social golfers, each of whom play golf once a week, and always in groups of 4. They would like you to come up with a schedule of play for these golfers, to last as many weeks as possible, such that no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer on more than one occasion.\nPossible variants of the above problem include: finding a 10-week schedule with \"maximum socialisation\"; that is, as few repeated pairs as possible (this has the same solutions as the original problem if it is possible to have no repeated pairs), and finding a schedule of minimum length such that each golfer plays with every other golfer at least once (\"full socialisation\").\n\nThe problem can easily be generalized to that of scheduling $m$ groups of $n$ golfers over $p$ weeks, such that no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer twice (i.e. maximum socialisation is achieved).\n\nThis problem is derived from a question posted to sci.op-research by\nbigwind777@aol.com (Bigwind777) in May 1998. It is a generalisation of the\nproblem of constructing a\nround-robin tournament schedule, where the number\nof players in a \"game\" is\nmore than two. The optimal solution for 32 golfers is not yet known.",

You are required to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket).\n\nWhat is the minimum number of transfers of water between buckets? The challenge is to solve this as a planning problem (encoded into satisfiability or constraint satisfaction) with an efficiency approaching (or exceeding) a simple [enumeration](models/enumerate.pl).",
  "---\nTitle:    Diamond-free Degree Sequences\nProposer: \n    - Alice Miller\n    - Patrick Prosser\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\nGiven a simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ the set of undirected edges, the edge {$u,v$} is in $E$ if and only if vertex u is adjacent to vertex $v  \\in G$. The graph is simple in that there are no loop edges, i.e. we have no edges of the form {$v,v$}. Each vertex $v \\in V$ has a degree dv i.e. the number of edges incident on that vertex. Consequently a graph has a degree sequence $d1,...,dn$, where $d_i >= d_{i+1}$. A diamond is a set of four vertices in $V$ such that there are at least five edges between those vertices. Conversely, a graph is diamond-free if it has no diamond as an induced subgraph, i.e. for every set of four vertices the number of edges between those vertices is at most four.\n\nIn our problem we have additional properties required of the degree sequences of the graphs, in particular that the degree of each vertex is greater than zero (i.e. isolated vertices are disallowed), the degree of each vertex is modulo $3$, and the sum of the degrees is modulo $12$ (i.e. $|E|$ is modulo $6$).\n\nThe problem is then for a given value of $n$, produce all unique degree sequences $d1,...,dn$ such that\n\n* $d_i \\ge d_{i+1}$\n* each degree $d_i > 0$ and $d_i$ is modulo $3$\n* the sum of the degrees is modulo $12$\n* there exists a simple diamond-free graph with that degree sequence\n\nBelow, as an example, is the unique degree sequence for$ n=10$ along with the adjacency matrix of a diamond-free graph with that degree sequence.\n\n      n = 10\n      6 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 \n\n      0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n      0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 \n      0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n      1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n      1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n      1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n      1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n      1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n      1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
  "---\nTitle:    Golomb rulers\nProposer: Peter van Beek\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\nThese problems are said to have many practical applications including sensor placements for x-ray crystallography and radio astronomy. A Golomb ruler may be defined as a set of $m$ integers $0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_m$ such that the $m(m-1)/2$ differences $a_j - a_i, 1 <= i < j <= m$ are distinct. Such a ruler is said to contain m marks and is of length $a_m$. The objective is to find optimal (minimum length) or near optimal rulers. Note that a symmetry can be removed by adding the constraint that $a_2 - a_1 < a_m - a_{m-1}$, the first difference is less than the last.\n\nThere is no requirement that a Golomb ruler measures all distances up to its length - the only requirement is that each distance is only measured in one way. However, if a ruler does measure all distances, it is classified as a *perfect* Golomb ruler.\n\nThere exist several interesting generalizations of the problem which have received attention like modular Golomb rulers (differences are all distinct mod a given base), disjoint Golomb rulers, Golomb rectangles (the 2-dimensional generalization of Golomb rulers), and difference triangle sets (sets of rulers with no common difference).\n\nFor a related problem, please see {prob076}.\n\nHere is a website which contains some more information on the problem: http://datagenetics.com/blog/february22013",

  "---\nTitle:    Number Partitioning\nProposer: Daniel Diaz\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\n\nThis problem consists in finding a partition of numbers $1..N$ into two sets A and B such that:\n\n1. A and B have the same cardinality\n2. sum of numbers in $A$ = sum of numbers in $B$\n3. sum of squares of numbers in $A$ = sum of squares of numbers in $B$\n\nThere is no solution for $N < 8$.\n\nHere is an example for$ N = 8$:$ A = (1,4,6,7)$ and $B = (2,3,5,8)$\n\nThen from $N \\>= 8$, there is no solution if $N$ is not a multiple of $4$.\n\n### Generalisation\n\nMore constraints can thus be added, e.g also impose the equality on the sum of cubes, ...\n\nLet $C_k$ be the constraint about the power $k$ defined as the equality :\n\n$\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} A_i^k = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} B_i^k$\n\nCondition (a) corresponds to $k=0$. Condition (b) to $k=1$. Condition (c) to $k=2$.\n\nThis generalized problem can be seen as a conjunction of constraints $C_k$ until a power P $(C_0 /\\\\ C_1 /\\\\ ... /\\\\ C_P)$. The above problem corresponds to $P = 2$.\n\nEmpirically, I played with $P = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:\n\nThe sums of powers is known :\n\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^0 = N$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^1 = N \\* (N+1) / 2$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^2 = N \\* (N+1) \\* (2\\*N + 1) / 6$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^3 = N^2 \\* (N+1)^2 / 4$\n-   $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^4 = N \\* (N+1) \\* (6\\*N^3 + 9\\*N^2 + N - 1) / 30$\n\n\nRecall in our case we need the half sums. The problem has no solution if the above sums are not even numbers. For P = 0 this implies N is a multiple of 2 (groups A and B have the same cardinality). For P = 1 (knowing N is multiple of 2 due to P = 0) then N \\* (N + 1) / 2 is even iff N is multiple of 4.\n\nHere are the first solutions computed:\n\n-   $P = 0$: first solutions found for $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...$ (obviously for every multiple of 2)\n-   $P = 1$: first solutions found for $N = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)\n-   $P = 2$: first solutions found for $N = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)\n-   $P = 3$: first solutions found for$ N = 16, 24, 32, 40 $(then for every multiple of 8 ?)\n-   $P = 4$: first solutions found for$ N = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64$ (then forevery multiple of 8 ?)\n\nFrom these tests, it seems the smallest N for which a solution exists is $2^{P+1}$. Can this be proved ?\n\nAfter that, it seems there are only solutions for N multiple of 2 (P= 0), 4 (P = 1 or 2), 8 (P = 3 or 4). Is this a constant depending on P ?\n\nAnother way to generalize this problem consists in increasing the numbers of groups (for instance consider 3 groups A, B, C).",

It is reported to have been devised by a member of staff in the Management Science department, who was a member of an amateur orchestra and formalized the problem whilst waiting to play during a rehearsal.\n\nA concert is to consist of nine pieces of music of different durations each involving a different combination of the five members of the orchestra.\n\nPlayers can arrive at rehearsals immediately before the first piece in which they are involved and depart immediately after the last piece in which they are involved. The problem is to devise an order in which the pieces can be rehearsed  so as to minimize the total time that players are waiting to play, i.e. the total time when players are present but not currently playing.\n\nIn the table below, 1 indicates that the player is required for the corresponding  piece, 0 otherwise. The duration (i.e. time required to rehearse each piece) is in some unspecified time units.\n\n\n<TABLE>\n   <TR><TD>Piece </TD><TD>   1 </TD><TD>  2</TD><TD>   3 </TD><TD>  4 </TD><TD>  5</TD><TD>   6 </TD><TD>  7</TD><TD>   8</TD><TD>   9 </TR>\n   <TR><TD>Player 1 </TD><TD> 1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   0</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   0</TD><TD>   1 </TR>\n   <TR><TD>Player 2</TD><TD>  1</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   0</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   0</TD><TD>   1</TD><TD>   0 </TR>\n   <TR><TD>Player 3</TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0 </TR>\n   <TR><TD>Player 4 </TD><TD> 1 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  1 </TR>\n   <TR><TD>Player 5</TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  0 </TR>\n<TR><TD>Duration </TD><TD> 2 </TD><TD>  4 </TD><TD>  1 </TD><TD>  3 </TD><TD>  3 </TD><TD>  2 </TD><TD>  5 </TD><TD>  7 </TD><TD>  6 </TR>\n</TABLE>\n\n\nFor example, if the nine  pieces were rehearsed in numerical order as given above, then the total waiting time would be:\n\nPlayer 1: 1+3+7=11\n\nPlayer 2: 1+5=6\n\nPlayer 3: 1+3+3+2=9\n\nPlayer 4: 4+1+3+5+7=20\n\nPlayer 5: 3\n\ngiving a total of 49 units.  The optimal sequence gives 17 units waiting time.\n\n<H3>The Talent Scheduling Problem</H3>\n\nA very similar problem occurs in devising a schedule for shooting a film. Different days of shooting require different subsets of the cast, and cast members are paid for days they spend on set waiting.

  "---\nTitle:    Maximum Clique\nProposer: Ciaran McCreesh\nCategory: Combinatorial mathematics\n---\n\nGiven a simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices\nand $E$ the set of undirected edges, a clique is a subset of $V$ such that each\ndistinct pair of vertices in this subset are adjacent. The maximum clique\nproblem is to find a clique of largest cardinality within a given graph. (The\nrelated clique enumeration problem is to enumerate all maximal cliques---that\nis, cliques which cannot be extended by adding an additional vertex.)\n\nThe second DIMACS implementation challenge studied this problem, and provided a\nstandard set of benchmark instances in a simple file format. These instances\nare of varying size and difficulty: some should be trivial, but a few are still\nopen. A simple example of a file is:\n\n<pre>\nc Lines that start with a c are comments. There is one line at the start\nc which starts with either \"p edge\" or \"p col\", followed by the number of\nc vertices and the (possibly incorrect) number of edges. The e lines each\nc describe an edge. Some files have blank lines.\np edge 5 6\ne 1 2\ne 2 3\ne 3 4\ne 4 1\ne 3 5\ne 4 5\n</pre>\n\nThis describes a graph with 5 vertices (which are numbered 1 to 5) and 6 edges.\nThe edges number is *not reliable* and should be ignored. Some instances\ninclude (some) edges in both directions, whilst others do not. Some files\ncontain loops (vertices adjacent to themselves), which should be ignored for\nthe clique problem.\n\nThe maximum clique in this file has size 3, with vertices 3, 4 and 5.\n\nOther datasets are available, also using this format.\n\nThe maximum clique problem is equivalent to the maximum independent set problem\nand the vertex cover problem. It is also used as an intermediate step in\nsolving the maximum common subgraph problem.",

  "The combinatorial auction problem is an auction in which bidders can place bids on combinations of items, or 'packages,' rather than just individual items. The problem is specified as follows: Given a set of items Q = {q1,...,qn} and a set of bids B = {b1,...,bm} such that each bid is bi = (Qi, ri), where Qi is a subset of Q and ri is a strictly positive real number. The task is to find a subset of bids B' such that any two bids in B' do not share an item, with the goal of maximizing the sum of the ri values of the selected bids. The problem is to ensure that each item is selected at most once. An example auction could be as follows: b1 = {1,2,3,4}, r1 = 8; b2 = {2,3,6}, r2 = 6; b3 = {1,4,5}, r3 = 5; b4 = {2,8}, r4 = 2; b5 = {5,6}, r5 = 2. The optimal assignment in this case would be the bids 2 and 3: {2,3,6} and {1,4,5} to a cost of 6+5 = 11.",

  "The given MiniZinc code defines a problem of generating a powerset of a set of size 'n'. A powerset is the set of all subsets of a set, including the empty set and the set itself. The code defines two types of powersets: 'ps1' and 'ps2'. 'ps1' is a binary matrix where each row represents a subset of the set {1,2,...,n} in binary format. 'ps2' is a matrix where each row represents a subset of the set {1,2,...,n} in a different format: each element in a row is the product of the corresponding element in the binary representation and the position of the element in the set (counting from the end). The problem is to find such matrices 'ps1' and 'ps2' that satisfy these conditions.",

  "The problem is about carpool fairness. In this scenario, n people are sharing a carpool for m days. Each person may choose whether to participate in the carpool on each day. The goal is to allocate the daily driving responsibilities 'fairly'. One possible approach is to split the responsibilities based on how many people use the car. So, on a day when k people use the carpool, each person incurs a responsibility of 1/k. That is, for each person i, we calculate his or her driving obligation Oi. We can then require that person i drives no more than Oi times every m days. The problem is to minimize the differences between Oi and the actual value to get as fair schedule as possible.",

The hypothesis is that the answer is n^{n-1}, but it needs to be proven. If restriction 2) is removed, the answer is obviously n^n. The problem also involves finding the number of different row patterns for different values of n. The patterns seem to follow the Catalan numbers.",
  "The problem is about finding superpermutations. In combinatorial mathematics, a superpermutation on n symbols is a string that contains each permutation of n symbols as a substring. Superpermutations can be shorter than the sum of all permutations because overlap is allowed. For instance, in the case of n = 2, the superpermutation 1221 contains all possible permutations (12 and 21), but the shorter string 121 also contains both permutations. It has been shown that for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 5, the smallest superpermutation on n symbols has length 1! + 2! + \u2026 + n! The task is to find the smallest superpermutation for a given n. The problem is solved by minimizing the length of the superpermutation, subject to the constraints that each permutation must appear as a substring, all permutations must be different, the first n symbols must be in order, and the superpermutation must be a palindrome.",

The model creates a binary matrix to indicate which integer is included in which partition. The model also calculates the sum of the integers in each partition. The constraints ensure that each integer is only in one partition and that the sum of the integers in each partition and the binary matrix are correctly calculated. The output is the partitions, the sum of the integers in each partition, and the binary matrix.",
  "In the SONET problem we are given a set of nodes, and for each pair of nodes we are given the demand (which is the number of channels required to carry network traffic between the two nodes). The demand may be zero, in which case the two nodes do not need to be connected.\n\nA SONET ring connects a set of nodes. A node is installed on a ring using a piece of equipment called an add-drop multiplexer (ADM). Each node may be installed on more than one ring. Network traffic can be transmitted from one node to another only if they are both installed on the same ring.

The demand of a pair of nodes may be split between multiple rings.\n\nThe objective is to minimise the total number of ADMs used while satisfying all demands.",
  "The problem is about arranging a matrix-like list of lists of values subject to certain constraints. The matrix consists of m randomly generated rows with up to n distinct values (no repeats within the row). The goal is to arrange the matrix such that the following conditions hold (if possible):\n\n1) The matrix must be \"lower triangular\"; the rows must be ordered in ascending lengths so the only \"gaps\" are in the top right corner.\n\n2) If a value appears in more than one row it must be in the same column (i.e., rearranging the order of values in a row is allowed).\n\nThe problem is to find a solution that satisfies these constraints or to determine that no solution is possible. For example, given the matrix:\n\nA B\nC E D\nC A B\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\nA B\nE D C\nA B C\n\nSince A, B, and C all appear in columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively. However, not all matrices have a solution. For instance, the matrix:\n\nA B C\nA B D\nB C D\n\nHas no solution since the constraints require the third row to have the C and D in the third column which is not possible.",
  "Given a group of people, the problem is to divide them into 'm' teams of size 'n'. The total number of people is 'nm'. The task is to enumerate all the ways this can be done. The order of elements within each subset does not matter, and the order of the subsets doesn't matter. This means that a team of Alice and Bob is the same as a team of Bob and Alice, and Alice-Bob versus Charlie-David is the same as Charlie-David versus Alice-Bob. The number of ways of doing this is calculated as (nm)!/n!mm!. This problem uses a variant representation where 'x' is a m*n array with decision variables of 1..m, i.e., the assignments of the team to a person. The constraints ensure that there are exactly 'n' members in each team and the first occurrences of the team numbers (1..m) must be in order.",

  "The problem is known as the Lichtenstein coloring problem. Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes, which do not satisfy the connectivity requirement of the four color map theorem. Just four of the communes consist of a single connected area (Ruggell, Schellenberg and Mauren in the north, and Triesen in the south). In the map, each commune is assigned its own color, and so we have an 11-coloring. The problem is to find out if we could make do with fewer colors. There is a five-clique within the map; that is, there are five communes that all share a segment of border with one another. It follows that a four-coloring is impossible. The question is, is there a five-coloring? What is the chromatic number of Liechtenstein? The problem is modeled and solved using the MiniZinc constraint programming language. The model includes constraints for the communes, enclaves/exclaves, neighbors, colors for the en-/exclaves, colors for the communes, what colors are used (for minimizing number of colors), and number of colors used. The goal is to minimize the number of colors used.",

  "The problem is about generating balanced brackets of size m*2 using MiniZinc. A balanced bracket is a string that consists of only brackets, which can be either open '[' or closed ']', and is balanced if it starts with an open bracket, ends with a closed bracket, and at any point in the string, the number of open brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closed brackets. The number of solutions generated for m follows the Catalan numbers sequence. The model uses an array x of size n (which is m*2) where each element can be either 0 (representing an open bracket) or 1 (representing a closed bracket), and an array c of size n which is a counter (cumulative) that increments by 1 if the corresponding element in x is 0 (open bracket) and decrements by 1 if it is 1 (closed bracket).

  "The problem is based on the 'numbers round' from the UK TV quiz show called Countdown. In this round, there are some cards laid face down in front of the host - the top row contains 'large' numbers (from the set 25, 50, 75, 100), and the rest are 'small' (1 to 10). Six cards are picked and displayed: the choice is made by one of the contestants, who typically will ask for one large number and five small ones. A machine called 'Cecil' picks a target number between 100 and 999 at random. The contestants then have 30 seconds to find a way of combining the source numbers using the normal arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to make the target number, or to get as close as possible. Each source card can be used no more than once. The same applies to any intermediate results. The task is to write a program which will accept one target number and a list of source numbers, and generate a solution which calculates the target or a number as close to the target as possible. This MiniZinc model is more restricted in how the operators work: It only solves solutions of a specific form.",

  "The problem is defined by the open_among constraint. Given a set of positions S, a number NVAR, a collection of variables, and a set of values, the constraint is satisfied if the number of variables at the positions specified by S that take their value from the set of values is equal to NVAR. For example, given the set of positions S={2,3,4,5}, the number NVAR=3, the collection of variables <8,5,5,4,1>, and the set of values {1,5,8}, the constraint is satisfied because exactly 3 values from the last four values of the collection of variables belong to the set of values.",
  "The problem is about implementing the global constraint 'atleast_nvalue' in MiniZinc.

The task is to define a model that takes an array of integers and a value 'nval', and checks if the array satisfies the 'atleast_nvalue' constraint with 'nval'. The model should also include a helper predicate to convert an array to a set, and a predicate 'cp1d' to ensure that two arrays have the same elements in the same order.",

It is also useful for constraining the number of occurrences of the least used value without knowing this value in advance and without giving explicitly a lower limit on the number of occurrences of each value as it is done in the global_cardinality constraint. The goal is to find a satisfying assignment for the variables such that the min_nvalue constraint holds.",
  "Consider a directed graph G described by a collection of nodes. The task is to select a subset of arcs of G such that the corresponding graph is symmetric. This means that if there is an arc from node i to node j, there must also be an arc from node j to i. For example, consider the following nodes and their successors: \n\nindex-1 succ-{1,2,3},\nindex-2 succ-{1,3},\nindex-3 succ-{1,2},\nindex-4 succ-{5,6},\nindex-5 succ-{4},\nindex-6 succ-{4}\n\nThe symmetric constraint holds since the nodes collection depicts a symmetric graph. The problem is to find such a symmetric subset of arcs for a given directed graph.",
  "The problem is about a global constraint in MiniZinc called 'element_matrix'. The 'element_matrix' constraint is defined for a two-dimensional matrix MATRIX[1..MAX_I,1..MAX_J]. The constraint holds if the VALUE is equal to the entry MATRIX[INDEX_I,INDEX_J] of the matrix. For example, if we have a 4x3 matrix and the INDEX_I=1 and INDEX_J=3, the constraint holds if the VALUE=7 is equal to the value of the matrix at the position (1,3). The problem is to find the values of INDEX_I, INDEX_J, and VALUE that satisfy the 'element_matrix' constraint for a given matrix.",
  "The problem is about finding the position of the ith non-zero item in a sequence of variables. Given a sequence of variables, the position (POS) is the position of the ITHth non-zero item of the sequence. For example, given the sequence [3,0,0,8,6], the position of the 2nd non-zero item is 4. The problem is to verify this constraint for a given sequence, position and ith value.",
  "The problem is about finding a permutation of two collections of variables, VARIABLES1 and VARIABLES2, such that each value in a given set of VALUES is taken by at least a certain minimum and at most a certain maximum number of variables in the VARIABLES1 collection. The VALUES set is a collection of tuples, where each tuple contains a value, a minimum occurrence (omin), and a maximum occurrence (omax). The variables in the VARIABLES2 collection should correspond to the variables in the VARIABLES1 collection according to a permutation. The problem is to find such a permutation that satisfies these conditions. For example, given the collections VARIABLES1 = <1,9,1,5,2,1>, VARIABLES2 = <9,1,1,1,2,5>, and VALUES = <(1,2,3), (2,1,1), (5,1,1), (7,0,2), (9,1,1)>, the permutation satisfies the conditions because the values 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 are respectively used 3, 1, 1, 0, and 1 times, which are within their respective minimum and maximum occurrences.",
  "The problem is about implementing the global constraint cardinality_atleast in MiniZinc. The cardinality_atleast constraint is defined as the minimum number of times that a value from a given set of values is taken by the variables of a given collection. The constraint holds if the first argument, ATLEAST, is assigned to the minimum number of times that the values from the given set occur in the collection. For example, given the values 3 and 8 and the collection <3, 3, 8>, the values 3 and 8 are respectively used 2, and 1 times. The cardinality_atleast constraint holds since its first argument ATLEAST = 1 is assigned to the minimum number of times that values 3 and 8 occur in the collection <3, 3, 8>.",
  "The problem is about implementing the global constraint cond_lex_cost in MiniZinc. The cond_lex_cost constraint is defined such that a given VECTOR is assigned to the COSTth item of the collection PREFERENCE_TABLE. The VECTOR and PREFERENCE_TABLE are both arrays of integers. The COST is an integer representing the position of the VECTOR in the PREFERENCE_TABLE. The problem is to find a VECTOR and its position in the PREFERENCE_TABLE such that the cond_lex_cost constraint holds. The PREFERENCE_TABLE is a 2-dimensional array of size n by m, where n and m are integers. The VECTOR is a 1-dimensional array of size m. The position is an integer between 1 and n. The problem is solved when the VECTOR is found in the PREFERENCE_TABLE at the specified position.",
  "The problem is about enforcing all variables of a collection to belong to distinct intervals. The intervals are defined by [SIZE_INTERVAL*k, SIZE_INTERVAL*k+SIZE_INTERVAL-1] where k is an integer. For example, if we have a collection of variables (2,3,10) and SIZE_INTERVAL=3, it defines the following family of intervals [3*k, 3*k+2], where k is an integer. Since the three variables of the collection take values that are respectively located within the three following distinct intervals [0, 2], [3, 5] and [9, 11], the alldifferent_interval constraint holds. The problem is to find such intervals for a given collection of variables and a SIZE_INTERVAL.",
  "The problem is about implementing the balance_modulo constraint in MiniZinc. The balance_modulo constraint is defined as follows: Given a set of variables, consider the largest set S1 and the smallest set S2 of variables that have the same remainder when divided by a given number M. The balance_modulo constraint is satisfied if the difference between the cardinality of S2 and the cardinality of S1 is equal to a given balance. The problem requires to enforce a balanced assignment of values, no matter how many distinct equivalence classes will be used. In this case, the maximum value of the balance_modulo constraint is minimized. The problem is modeled by creating an array of variables, a balance variable, and a modulo number. The balance_modulo predicate is defined to check the balance_modulo constraint. The problem is solved by satisfying the balance_modulo constraint.",
  "The problem is about implementing the global constraint nvalues_except_0 in MiniZinc. The constraint nvalues_except_0(VARIABLES,RELOP,LIMIT) is defined as follows: Let N be the number of distinct values, different from 0, assigned to the variables of the VARIABLES collection. The condition N\u2006RELOP\u2006LIMIT should hold. Here, VARIABLES is a collection of variables, RELOP is a comparison operator, and LIMIT is a limit value. The comparison operator is coded as: '<' is -2, '<=' is -1, '=' is 0, '>=' is 1, '>' is 2. An example of this constraint is (<4,5,5,4,0,1>,=,3). The nvalues_except_0 constraint holds since the number of distinct values, different from 0, occurring within the collection <4,5,5,4,0,1> is equal (i.e., RELOP is set to =) to its third argument LIMIT=3. The problem is to find the variables, relop, and limitx that satisfy this constraint.",
  "The problem is defined by two constraints: 'common' and 'used_by'. The 'common' constraint is defined as follows: Given two collections of variables, VARIABLES1 and VARIABLES2, NCOMMON1 is the number of variables in VARIABLES1 taking a value in VARIABLES2, and NCOMMON2 is the number of variables in VARIABLES2 taking a value in VARIABLES1. For example, if VARIABLES1 is <1, 9, 1, 5> and VARIABLES2 is <2, 1, 9, 9, 6, 9>, then NCOMMON1 is 3 (the number of values in VARIABLES1 that occur in VARIABLES2) and NCOMMON2 is 4 (the number of values in VARIABLES2 that occur in VARIABLES1). The 'used_by' constraint is defined as follows: All the values of the variables of collection VARIABLES2 are used by the variables of collection VARIABLES1. For example, if VARIABLES1 is [1, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1] and VARIABLES2 is [1, 1, 2, 5], then all values in VARIABLES2 are used by VARIABLES1. The problem is to find values for the variables in VARIABLES1 and VARIABLES2 that satisfy these constraints.",
  "The problem is to find a solution for the 'minimum_weight_alldifferent' constraint. This constraint requires that all variables in a given collection should take a distinct value located within the interval [1, |VARIABLES|]. In addition, a cost is calculated which is equal to the sum of the costs associated with assigning value i to variable j. These costs are given by a matrix. The goal is to minimize this cost. An example of this problem would be a set of variables <2, 3, 1, 4> and a matrix of costs. The minimum_weight_alldifferent constraint holds since the cost 17 corresponds to the sum of certain elements in the matrix. The problem is solved using the MiniZinc modeling language, which includes global constraints and built-in predicates for handling arrays and matrices.",
  "The problem is about enforcing a lexicographical order on a matrix of domain variables. The matrix is defined such that both adjacent rows and adjacent columns are lexicographically ordered. This means that each row and each column must be in a non-decreasing order. For example, given a matrix with two rows and three columns, the first row <2, 2, 3> is lexicographically less than or equal to the second row <2, 3, 1>, the first column <2, 2> is lexicographically less than or equal to the second column <2, 3>, and the second column <2, 3> is lexicographically less than or equal to the third column <3, 1>.

  "The problem is defined by a global constraint called 'roots'. The constraint is defined as follows: Given a set S, a set T, and a collection of variables, S is the set of indices of the variables in the collection taking their values in T; S = {i | VARIABLES[i].var in T}. For example, given the sets S = {2, 4, 5}, T = {2, 3, 8}, and the collection of variables <1, 3, 1, 2, 3>, the roots constraint holds since values 2 and 3 in T occur in the collection <1, 3, 1, 2, 3> only at positions S={2, 4, 5}. The value 8 in T does not occur within the collection <1, 3, 1, 2, 3>. The problem is to find the values of the variables in the collection that satisfy this constraint.",
  "The problem is about partitioning a collection of variables into a certain number of classes. The goal is to find the number of partitions of the collection PARTITIONS such that at least one value is assigned to at least one variable of the collection VARIABLES. For example, given the values <3, 2, 7, 2, 6> and the partitions p-<1, 3>, p-<4>, and p-<2, 6>, the values occur within partitions p-<1, 3> and p-<2, 6> but not within p-<4>. Consequently, the nclass constraint holds since its first argument NCLASS is set to value 2. The problem is to find the values of the variables and the partitions that satisfy this constraint.",
  "The problem is about a constraint called 'sum_of_weights_of_distinct_values'. This constraint is applied to a collection of variables, a collection of values, and a cost. All variables in the VARIABLES collection take a value in the VALUES collection. In addition, COST is the sum of the weight attributes associated with the distinct values taken by the variables of VARIABLES. For example, if VARIABLES = <1,6,1>, VALUES = <val-1 weight-5, val-2 weight-3, val-6 weight-7>, and COST = 12, the constraint holds since COST=12 is equal to the sum 5+7 of the weights of the values 1 and 6 that occur within the VARIABLES collection. The goal is to find the variables, values, and cost that satisfy this constraint.",
  "The problem is about finding the minimum and maximum values in a set. Given a set S of size 4, with elements ranging from 1 to 10, the task is to find the minimum and maximum values in the set. The minimum value 'mn' is defined as a value that is in the set and for all elements 'e' in the set, 'mn' is less than or equal to 'e'. Similarly, the maximum value 'mx' is defined as a value that is in the set and for all elements 'e' in the set, 'mx' is greater than or equal to 'e'. The goal is to satisfy these conditions.",
  "The problem is about constraining all sequences of a given length (SEQ) from a collection of variables such that the sum of the variables in each sequence falls within a specified interval [LOW, UP]. For example, given a sequence length of 4 and a collection of variables <1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4>, the problem is to ensure that the sum of every 4 consecutive values in the collection is between 3 and 7. The constraint holds if the sums associated with the subsequences 1 4 2 0, 4 2 0 0, 2 0 0 3, and 0 0 3 4 are respectively 7, 6, 5 and 7, all of which are within the interval [3, 7].",
  "The problem is about arranging k-dimensional objects in a way that no two objects overlap. Each object is defined by a shape, which is a set of rectangles. Each rectangle in a shape is defined by its size in each dimension and its offset from the base position of the object. The base position of each object and the shape used by each object are decision variables. The problem also involves defining the lower and upper limits for each dimension. The objective is to minimize the sum of the upper limits. The problem is constrained such that each object must use a shape from a specific group of shapes. The problem is illustrated with an example where the objects are 2-dimensional shapes defined by a set of rectangles. The shapes are grouped into three groups, each group representing a different type of shape. The problem is to arrange these shapes in a 2-dimensional space such that no two shapes overlap and the sum of the upper limits in each dimension is minimized.",
  "The problem is about finding the number of distinct pairs in a given collection. The collection is represented as a 2D array, where each row represents a pair. The number of distinct pairs is represented by the variable 'npairs'. The problem is to assign values to the pairs in such a way that the number of distinct pairs equals 'npairs'. The pairs are considered distinct based on both elements of the pair, not just one. For example, in the given collection of pairs [(3,1), (1,5), (3,1), (3,1), (1,5)], the number of distinct pairs is 2, which are (3,1) and (1,5). The problem is solved when the number of distinct pairs in the collection equals the given 'npairs' value.",
  "The problem is about implementing four global constraints: cond_lex_less, cond_lex_lesseq, cond_lex_greater, and cond_lex_greatereq in MiniZinc. These constraints are used to compare two vectors, VECTOR1 and VECTOR2, based on a preference table. The preference table is a collection where VECTOR1 and VECTOR2 are assigned to the Ith and Jth items such that I < J. The constraints are defined as follows: \n\n- cond_lex_less: VECTOR1 is less than VECTOR2\n- cond_lex_lesseq: VECTOR1 is less than or equal to VECTOR2\n- cond_lex_greater: VECTOR1 is greater than VECTOR2\n- cond_lex_greatereq: VECTOR1 is greater than or equal to VECTOR2\n\nThe problem also involves a generalized version of these constraints, cond_lex_op, which takes an additional parameter, xop, to specify the type of comparison operator. The comparison operator can be one of the following: -2 for less than, -1 for less than or equal, 0 for equal, 1 for greater than or equal, 2 for greater than, and any other value for not equal. \n\nThe problem is to find assignments for VECTOR1 and VECTOR2 such that the specified constraint holds.

  "The problem is about enforcing two vectors to differ from at least K positions. Given two vectors, VECTOR1 and VECTOR2, and an integer K, the task is to ensure that VECTOR1 and VECTOR2 differ from at least K positions. For example, if K=2, VECTOR1=<2, 5, 2, 0>, and VECTOR2=<3, 6, 2, 1>, the constraint holds since the first and second vectors differ from 3 positions, which is greater than or equal to K=2.",
  "The problem is about cumulative scheduling constraint or scheduling under resource constraints. It involves a set T of tasks described by the TASKS collection. The cumulative constraint enforces that at each point in time, the cumulated height of the set of tasks that overlap that point, does not exceed a given limit. It also imposes for each task of T the constraint origin+duration=end. Each task is represented by a set of rectangles coloured with the same colour: the sum of the lengths of the rectangles corresponds to the duration of the task, while the height of the rectangles corresponds to the resource consumption of the task. The cumulative constraint holds since at each point in time we don't have a cumulated resource consumption strictly greater than the upper limit enforced by the last argument of the cumulative constraint. The goal is to minimize the maximum end time of the tasks.",
  "The problem is about enforcing two constraints on a collection of variables. The first constraint is that all variables in the collection must take distinct values. The second constraint is that the difference between the largest and the smallest values of the variables collection must be equal to the number of variables minus one, which means there are no holes at all within the used values. An example of a valid collection of variables would be (5,4,3,6). The problem is modeled in MiniZinc, a high-level constraint modeling language.",
  "The problem is about filling a 4x6 table with 18 ticks such that the sum of ticks on each column and row is even and no row or column is empty. The decision variable is a 2D array 'x' of size 4x6 where each element can be either 0 or 1. The objective is to find a configuration of the table that satisfies the constraints. The constraints are: the total number of ticks is 18; the sum of ticks in each row and each column is even; and no row or column is empty. The problem does not have an optimization goal, it is a satisfaction problem. The problem is solved using an integer search strategy that selects the variable with the smallest domain first (first_fail) and assigns it the smallest value in its domain (indomain_min).",
  "The problem is about finding permutations and their corresponding permutation numbers. A permutation number is the number of transpositions in a permutation. The problem requires to find an array 'x' of size 'n' such that all elements in 'x' are different and satisfy a certain permutation number. The permutation number is calculated by counting the number of elements in the array 'x' that are lower than the current element for each element in the array. The problem also requires to determine if the permutation number is even or odd. The solution should output the array 'x', the permutation number, and whether the permutation number is even or odd.",
  "The problem is a nonmonotonic reasoning problem known as the Penguin problem. The assumptions are as follows: Birds which are not abnormal fly (i.e., birds usually fly). Penguins are considered abnormal. Penguins and eagles are birds. Tweety is a penguin and Toto is an eagle. The problem is to deduce which of these two birds can fly. The answer is that Toto, the eagle, can fly, while Tweety, the penguin, cannot.",
  "The problem is to define the concept of antisymmetric in the context of a relation. An antisymmetric relation is one where no element is related to itself (no one is richer than him-/herself) and if one element is related to another, the second is not related to the first (if i is richer than j then j is not richer than i). The problem is modeled as a 4x4 matrix where each cell represents a binary relation between two elements. The goal is to find a configuration of this matrix that satisfies the antisymmetric property. Two versions of the antisymmetric property are defined, one directly from the definition and another as an alternative version.",
  "The given MiniZinc code defines four predicates to find the position of the maximum and minimum elements in an array. The array 'x' is of size 'n' and contains elements from 1 to 'n'. The variable 'pos' is the position of the maximum or minimum element in the array. The four predicates are: \n\n1. argmax_gt: This predicate checks if 'pos' is the position of the maximum element in the array. There can be only one maximum value.\n\n2. argmax_ge: This predicate checks if 'pos' is the position of the maximum element(s) in the array. There can be multiple maximum values.\n\n3. argmin_lt: This predicate checks if 'pos' is the position of the minimum element in the array.

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 13 places, hence the name Rot 13. The problem has a string of length 10 and an alphabet of length 26. The goal is to find the rotated string and the rotation number such that for each character in the string, the rotated character is the character in the alphabet that is 'rot' places down from the original character. If the rotation goes beyond the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning.",
  "The problem is about modeling family relations using MiniZinc. The family database is ported from the book 'Programming with Constraints' by Marriott & Stuckey. The family consists of 9 members, each represented by a unique integer. The family relations are represented as father and mother relations. The father relations are represented as a 2D array of size 6x2, and the mother relations are represented as a 2D array of size 2x2. The age of each family member is also given. The problem defines several predicates to represent different family relations such as father, mother, parent, sibling, and cousin.

  "The problem is about shuffling the characters of a string in such a way that as many of the character values are in a different position as possible. The result should be printed as follows: original string, shuffled string, (score). The score gives the number of positions whose character value did not change. For example: tree, eetr, (0). A shuffle that produces a randomized result among the best choices is to be preferred. A deterministic approach that produces the same sequence every time is acceptable as an alternative.

  "The problem is about generating a sequence of Fibonacci numbers using MiniZinc. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. However, in this problem, the sequence starts with 1 and 1. The task is to calculate the first 'n' numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where 'n' is a given integer. The challenge is that recursion, a common method for generating Fibonacci numbers, is not allowed in MiniZinc. Therefore, an array is used to store and calculate the sequence. The output is the sequence of the first 'n' Fibonacci numbers.",
  "The problem is about identifying the sequence and sum of N natural increasing numbers. The sequence is written in groups: 1; 2,3; 4,5,6; 7,8,9,10; ... and the task is to add the groups.

The task is to generate a Collatz sequence for a given number 'n' and calculate the length of the sequence until the number 1 is reached for the first time. The sequence is represented as an array 'x' of length 'max_len', which is three times the value of 'n'. The length of the sequence until the first occurrence of 1 is represented by the variable 'len'. The sequence must satisfy the conditions of the Collatz conjecture, i.e., each element 'x[i]' in the sequence must be either half of 'x[i-1]' if 'x[i-1]' is even, or (3*'x[i-1]'+1)/2 if 'x[i-1]' is odd. The sequence must also satisfy the condition that there exists an index 'i' such that 'x[i]' is 1 and 'len' is 'i-1', and all elements before 'x[i]' are greater than 1.

The divisors are stored in an array 'divisor' of size 't' where 't' is half of 'n' plus one. A variable 'is_prime' is used to check if 'n' is a prime number. If 'n' has no divisors (other than 1 and itself), then 'n' is a prime number and 'is_prime' is set to 1, otherwise 'is_prime' is set to 0.

  "The problem is to calculate the factorial of a given number 'n' using MiniZinc. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. The factorial function can be defined by the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. However, since the prod() function is not available in MiniZinc, an alternative method is used to calculate the factorial. An array 'x' of size 'n' is created where each element 'x[i]' is the product of 'x[i-1]' and 'i'. The result 'res' is the last element of the array 'x'. The maximum value of 'n' that can be used depends on the solver used. For example, with the 'flatzinc' solver, the maximum 'n' is 9, while with the 'fz', 'ic', 'eplex', and 'tini' solvers, the maximum 'n' is 12. With the 'fd' solver, the maximum 'n' is 10.
